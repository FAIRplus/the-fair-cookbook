Biaryl compounds, with two connected aromatic rings, are found across medicine, materials science and asymmetric 
catalysis1,2. The necessity of joining arene building blocks to access these valuable compounds has inspired several 
approaches for biaryl bond formation and challenged chemists to develop increasingly concise and robust methods for
this task3. Oxidative coupling of two C–H bonds offers an efficient strategy for the formation of a biaryl C–C bond; 
however, fundamental challenges remain in controlling the reactivity and selectivity for uniting a given pair of
substrates4,5. Biocatalytic oxidative cross-coupling reactions have the potential to overcome limitations inherent to
numerous small-molecule-mediated methods by providing a paradigm with catalyst-controlled selectivity6.
