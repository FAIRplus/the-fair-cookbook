# Reusability

+++
---

Optimising the reuse of data is the ultimate goal, and to achieve this, metadata and data should be well-described so that they can be used, replicated and combined in different settings.

For data objects to be reusable, additional criteria are:
- Data objects should be compliant with principles of findability, accessibility and interoperability.
- (Meta) data should be sufficiently well-described and rich that it can be automatically (with minimal human effort) linked or integrated, with relevant data sources.
- Published data objects should refer to their sources with rich enough metadata and provenance to enable proper citation.

This chapter is dedicated to the `standards`, `licenses`, `practices` and other `resources` necessary to improving the reusability of data.

Browse existing recipes, but bear in mind that this is a ‘live resource’, and recipes are added and improved, iteratively, in an open manner.
