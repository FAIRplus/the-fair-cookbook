```{admonition} Important
:class: tip
This section is highly standardized and is relied upon by another component developed by FAIRplus to enhance search and presentation. It is therefore important to comply with the layout. 
The authors should therefore edit the all but the `recipe metadata`. 
For the `Intended Audience` section, the allowed values should be picked from the following list:

    - Funder
    - Procurement Officer
    - Principal Investigator
    - Data Curator
    - Data Manager
    - Data Scientist
        - Chemoinformatician
        - Bioinformatician
    - Software Engineer
    - System Administrator
    - Terminology Manager
    - Ontologist


For the `Recipe Type` section, the allowed values should be picked from the following list:

    - Background information (introductory material)
    - Survey / Review (state of the art material)
    - Guidance (documentation aimed at both technical and non-technical audience)
    - Technical Guidance (documentation aimed at a technical audience, without executable code examples)
    - Hands-on (documentation aimed at a technical audience, with executable code examples available as jupyter notebooks)

The main purpose of this recipe is:

> Provid a summary statement about the purpose of the recipe.

## Graphical Overview

```{note} 
use this section to provide a decision tree for the overall process described in the recipe
For more information about the syntax used to generate the diagram, please refer to the [following documentation](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/flowchart)
```


```{warning}

Do make sure to save the mermaid diagram in a separate file using the '.mmd' extension. This is required for building the book as the images are generated by the build process. 
All the images will be generated as png files.

```

Then reference the figure using the Alan Turing Institute style as shown below:


```{figure} ./images/C-3PO_droid.png
---
width: 200px
name: This is a Robot
alt: C-3PO_droid
---
C-3PO_droid 
```


---


## Requirements

* technical requirements:
   * bash knowledge
   * ...
* recipe dependency:
   * read Recipe 1 first!
* knowledge requirement:
   * be sure to know what OBO is, or read it here: ...link to knowledge...

## FAIRification Objectives, Inputs and Outputs

```{admonition} Important

## Table of Data Standards

```{admonition} Important
:class: tip
this section is relied upon by another component developed by FAIRplus to enhance search and presentation. It is therefore important to comply with the layout. 
```

Authors should list all the data standards, format specification, syntax and controlled terminologies used in the FAIRification process applied to the IMI project data.
Ideally, authors should mark up the information using either EDAM Ontology URI or FAIRsharing identifiers (which are DOIs)

| Data Formats  | Terminologies | Models  |
| :------------- | :------------- | :------------- |
| [FASTQ](https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.r2ts5t)  | [LOINC](https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.2mk2zb)  | [SRA XML](https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.q72e3w)  |

## Main Content

This is the place for your actual content. You can also ...

### ... write executable code


```python
import isatools
import json
import pandas as pd 
import holoview
```

### ...insert bibliographic references

````{admonition} Tip
:class: tip

If you need to include bibliographic reference, use the following syntax: 

```md
{footcite}`Gu2020`
```

````

This style of referencing will show up in text like this {footcite}`Gu2020`, and clicking on the link will take you to
the `Reference`section at the bottom of the page.


### ... create workflow figures

If you want to include figures, please use the following 


<!-- 
```{figure} ./my_figure.svg
---
width: 700px
name: the figure title
alt: something to display if the link to the figure is broken
---
the proper caption for the figure.
```
-->

one may use the following **[mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/)** syntax:
`````
````{panels} 
:container: container-lg pb-3
:column: col-lg-12 p-2
:card: rounded

```
graph LR;
    A[Data Acquisition] -->B(Raw Data)
    B --> C{FAIR by Design}
    C -->|Yes| D[Standard Compliant Data]
    C -->|No| E[Vendor locked Data]
```
````
`````

which is then rendered like this:

````{panels} 
:container: container-lg pb-3
:column: col-lg-12 p-2
:card: rounded

<div class="mermaid">
graph LR;
    A[Data Acquisition] -->B(Raw Data)
    B --> C{FAIR by Design}
    C -->|Yes| D[Standard Compliant Data]
    C -->|No| E[Vendor locked Data]
</div>
````

Authors of graphical representations using the mermaid syntax can also style their graphs, as shown below:
`````
````{panels} 
:container: container-lg pb-3
:column: col-lg-12 p-2
:card: rounded

<div class="mermaid">
graph TD;
    A[input data]-->B[conversion to open format]
    A[input data]-->C[automatic annotation]
    B[conversion to open format]-->D((output data))
    C[automatic annotation]-->D((output data))  
    style A fill:#FF5733,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style D fill:#0A749B,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
</div>
````
`````
