# Add via GoogleDocs 

+++

The FAIR cookbook content can be expanded by adding a recipe. We present here the easiest way to do so. Simply create content by using the [Google document Recipe template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C-cg1StazvPujky2SDatvMi26y7tzrbuT6xFQFS-6pw).

The default layout present in this Google Document is aligned with the recipe template available in `git` and to `HackMD` defined by the editorial group for the `Markdown` language.

The reason for this `Google Document template` is mainly to allow for rapid onboarding of contributors, delegating the nitty gritty editorial aspects to the tech track. However, to ease this integration, contributors using the Google templates are kindly requested to follow the outline whenever possible.

## Done writing? Notify an Cookbook Editor.

Once you feel your edits are complete and think your recipe is ready for release, you can choose between the following 2 approaches:

1. **Direct handover to an FAIR Cookbook Editor**:
If you are not comfortable with `Markdown` and `git`, this is the easiest route and this is what we recommend. Simply drop an email to [fairplus-cookbook@elixirhub.org](mailto:fairplus-cookbook@elixir-europe.org) stating the **recipe github issue** identifier.

2. **Convert to Markdown before handing over**:
If you wish to go a bit further and help the editors, you can convert the gdoc to markdown using an add-on to the Google document

    * install the extension, to do so , go to Menu `Add-ons`, then `Get Add-ons`, in the new window's search box, type `docs to Markdown`

    * Select the "Docs to Markdown" app from the Market Place

    * Once installed, you can invoke the tools by going to Menu item `add-ons`, then select `Docs to Markdown`, then go to `Convert` as shown below:

    * This will open a box on the right hand side of the Google Document

    * Hitting the `Markdown` button will convert the Google doc formatted document into a `Markdown` and `HTML` document, which can then be saved to pushed to github if people are comfortable with this. The conversion is not without caveats. The first one is that tables aren't really converted to Markdown but to HTML. Then any fancy Google doc features may be lost and misformatted, leading to downstream issues during the build process of the FAIRplus cookbook.
