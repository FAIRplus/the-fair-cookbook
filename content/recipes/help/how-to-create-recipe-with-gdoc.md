# Add via GoogleDocs 


The FAIR cookbook content can be expanded by adding a recipe. We present here the easiest way to do so.

Simply create content by using the [Google document Recipe template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C-cg1StazvPujky2SDatvMi26y7tzrbuT6xFQFS-6pw).


````{dropdown}
:open:
```{figure} ../../../images/3J0vm4q.png
---
width: 800px
name: Google Doc template
alt: Google Doc template
---
Google Doc template.
```
````



The default layout present in this Google Document is aligned with the recipe template available in **git** and 
to **HackMD** defined by the editorial group for the **Markdown** language.

The reason for this **Google Document template** is mainly to allow for rapid onboarding of contributors, delegating
the nitty-gritty editorial aspects to the tech track. However, to ease this integration, contributors using the Google
templates are kindly requested to follow the outline whenever possible.

## Done writing? Notify a Cookbook Editor.

Once you feel your edits are complete and think your recipe is ready for release, you can choose between the following 2 approaches:

1. **Direct handover to an FAIR Cookbook Editor**:
If you are not comfortable with **Markdown** and **git**, this is the easiest route and this is what we recommend.
Simply drop an email to [fairplus-cookbook@elixirhub.org](mailto:faircookbook-ed@elixir-europe.org) stating 
the **recipe GitHub issue** identifier.

2. **Convert to Markdown before handing over**:
If you wish to go a bit further and help the editors, you can convert the Google document to markdown using an add-on to the Google editor.

    * install the extension, to do so , go to Menu **Add-ons**, then **Get Add-ons**, in the new window's search box,
   type **docs to Markdown**


````{dropdown}
:open:
```{figure} ../../../images/6uXR3m3.png
---
width: 650px
name: Get Add-ons
alt: Get Add-ons
---
Get Add-ons.
```
````




   * Select the "Docs to Markdown" app from the Market Place

````{dropdown}
:open:
```{figure} ../../../images/F7VV50d.png
---
width: 200px
name: Docs to Markdown app
alt: Docs to Markdown app
---
Docs to Markdown app.
```
````


   * Once installed, you can invoke the tools by going to Menu item **add-ons**, then select **Docs to Markdown**, 
then go to **Convert** as shown below:


````{dropdown} Invoke Function
:open:
```{figure} ../../../images/A9LUMPs.png
---
width: 550px
name: Invoke Function
alt: Invoke Function.
---
Invoke Function
```
````

   * This will open a box on the right-hand side of the Google Document


````{dropdown} Widget Output
:open:
```{figure} ../../../images/R40RvpW.png
---
width: 750px
name: Widget Output
alt: Widget Output.
---
Widget Output
```
````

   * Hitting the **Markdown** button will convert the Google doc formatted document into a **Markdown** and **HTML** document,
 which can then be saved to pushed to GitHub if people are comfortable with this. The conversion is not without caveats.
 The first one is that tables aren't really converted to Markdown but to HTML. 
 Then any fancy Google doc features may be lost and mis-formatted, leading to downstream issues during the build 
 process of the FAIRplus cookbook.

:open:
```{figure} ../../../images/HGT9sdu.png

alt: Conversion to markdown.

```
````

One can now copy the resulting Markdown output to a file. If the contributor needs guidance on what do the next, 
the following contents should be of help.
> {ref}`fcb-help-recipe-hackmd`
> 
> {ref}`fcb-help-recipe-git`
> 
> One can also get in touch with the [FAIR Cookbook editors](mailto:faircookbook-ed@elixir-europe.org) for assistance.
