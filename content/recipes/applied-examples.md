This chapter is dedicated to FAIRification examples, using publicly available datasets. These include data from published articles, as well as data from multi-omics, observational and clinical trial projects.

Browse existing recipes, but bear in mind that this is a ‘live resource’, and recipes are added and improved, iteratively, in an open manner.
