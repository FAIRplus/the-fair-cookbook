# Contribute

This section is meant to provide basic information to users looking to contribute content to the `FAIR Cookbook`

To provide content, users have 3 options depending on the familiarity with git command and github environment.

It always start by getting in touch with the group by simply logging an issue in our [repository issue tracker](https://github.com/FAIRplus/the-fair-cookbook/issues)


* Provide content using the `Google doc template` 

* Provide content using `HackMD`

* Provide content by sending a `Pull Request`

Remember you can also provide a recipe in the form on Jupyter Notebook. For example, do you have FAIRification process for an existing data type (for instance, GWAS data) and you'd like to share this with the group?

Simply, fork the github repo, following the editing guidelines and the [Jupyter-Book documentation](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html), and give us a nudge when ready to submit.


We also provide a few tips and tricks that you can use to ease integration with the book

Thank you for your input, you are awesome!
