The FAIR Cookbook is a community-driven resource that is being populated and improved, iteratively, in an open manner. 
This section is meant to provide basic information to users looking to contribute content to the ***FAIR Cookbook***.


To provide content, you have the three follow options, which are detailed in their respective sections:

* Provide content using the ***Google doc template*** 

* Provide content using ***HackMD***

* Provide content using ***GitHub*** by sending a ***Pull Request*** to [our repository](https://github.com/FAIRplus/the-fair-cookbook/)

It always starts by getting in touch with the group, by simply logging an issue in our [repository issue tracker](https://github.com/FAIRplus/the-fair-cookbook/issues). 

Remember you can also provide a recipe in the form on Jupyter Notebook. Simply, fork the GitH   ub repo, following the editing guidelines and the [Jupyter-Book documentation](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html), and give us a nudge when you are ready to submit.

We also provide a few tips and tricks that you can use to ease integration with the book, as well as a [recipe template](https://github.com/FAIRplus/the-fair-cookbook/blob/migrating/content/recipes/help/recipe-template.md)

***Overview principles of what recipes should and should not be:***

The table below summarizes the key features we are seeking for our content.

```{tabbed} A recipe should be
| Qualifier  | *Example* |
| :------------- | :------------- | 
| **Specific**  | *Should target a specific task or action or tool and service that brings FAIRness one or more levels up; or provide an example of data FAIRification.* | 
| **Complete**  | *Should be an end-to-end recipe that users can follow and finish a task.* | 
| **Open**  | *Should be open, or,  the tools and services used, if proprietary, should have a “free” or “community” version available.*  | 
```
```{tabbed} But should not be
| Qualifier  | *Example* |
| :------------- | :------------- | 
| **Too Broad**  | *Should not be a repeat of the full user manual. Should not be a features list of a tool.* | 
| **Incomplete**  | *Should not be just a teaser that only shows a few steps at the beginning. Should not be an advertisement.* | 
| **Closed**  | *Should not allow testing it after purchasing a paid software.* | 
```
