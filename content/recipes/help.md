The FAIR Cookbook is a community-driven resource that is being populated and improved, iteratively, in an open manner. 
This section is meant to provide basic information to users looking to contribute content to the ***FAIR Cookbook***.


To provide content, you have the three follow options, which are detailed in their respective sections:

* Provide content using the ***Google doc template*** 

* Provide content using ***HackMD***

* Provide content using ***Github*** by sending a ***Pull Request*** to [our repository](https://github.com/FAIRplus/the-fair-cookbook/)

It always starts by getting in touch with the group, by simply logging an issue in our [repository issue tracker](https://github.com/FAIRplus/the-fair-cookbook/issues). 

Remember you can also provide a recipe in the form on Jupyter Notebook. Simply, fork the Github repo, following the editing guidelines and the [Jupyter-Book documentation](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html), and give us a nudge when you are ready to submit.

We also provide a few tips and tricks that you can use to ease integration with the book, as well as a [recipe template](https://github.com/FAIRplus/the-fair-cookbook/blob/migrating/content/recipes/help/recipe-template.md)

          <td><b>Too broad and high level</b></td>
          <td>Should not be a repeat of the full user manual. 
Should not be a features list of a tool.</td>

        <tr>
            <td><b>Complete</b></td>
            <td>Should be an end-to-end recipe that users can follow and finish a task.</td>
          <td><b>Incomplete</b></td>
          <td>Should not be just a teaser that only shows a few steps at the beginning.
Should not be an advertisement.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><b>FAIR</b></td>
            <td>The tools and services used should be open, or, if proprietary, a “free” or “community” version should be available.</td>
          <td><b>Closed</b></td>
          <td>Users can only test it after purchasing a paid software.</td>
        </tr>
