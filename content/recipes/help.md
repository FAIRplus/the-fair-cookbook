The FAIR Cookbook is a community-driven resource that is being populated and improved, iteratively, in an open manner. 
This section is meant to provide basic information to users looking to contribute content to the ***FAIR Cookbook***.


To provide content, you have the three follow options, which are detailed in their respective sections:

* Provide content using the ***Google doc template*** 

* Provide content using ***HackMD***

* Provide content using ***Github*** by sending a ***Pull Request*** to [our repository](https://github.com/FAIRplus/the-fair-cookbook/)

It always starts by getting in touch with the group, by simply logging an issue in our [repository issue tracker](https://github.com/FAIRplus/the-fair-cookbook/issues). 

Remember you can also provide a recipe in the form on Jupyter Notebook. Simply, fork the Github repo, following the editing guidelines and the [Jupyter-Book documentation](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html), and give us a nudge when you are ready to submit.

We also provide a few tips and tricks that you can use to ease integration with the book, as well as a [recipe template](https://github.com/FAIRplus/the-fair-cookbook/blob/migrating/content/recipes/help/recipe-template.md)

You can always contact us at [faircookbook-ed@elixir-europe.org](mailto:faircookbook-ed@elixir-europe.org).

Thank you in advance for your input, you are awesome!
