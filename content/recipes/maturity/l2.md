The most commonly used strategy to construct these molecules relies on metal-catalysed cross-coupling of 
prefunctionalized aryl fragments, thereby offering preprogrammed site selectivity, albeit at the expense of
adding extra steps in a synthetic campaign7,8 (Fig. 1b). These reactions can require extensive screening to 
identify suitable conditions for each new pair of coupling partners and are still restricted in the connectivities 
that are readily accessible9,10,11,12,13, with the formation of tetra-ortho-substituted biaryl bonds remaining an
outstanding challenge14,15. Oxidative coupling provides an alternative strategy for biaryl bond formation through the 
net transformation of two C–H bonds into a C–C bond4,5 (Fig. 1b). However, these advantages come at the expense of the
efficiency and selectivity of this transformation, which is typically dictated by the intrinsic steric and electronic
properties of each substrate, thereby limiting the versatility of this transformation4,16,17,18 (Fig. 1c).
