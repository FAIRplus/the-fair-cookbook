## Technology stack

The `FAIR Cookbook` is built using [jupyter-book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html), following the practice used by the [Alan Turing's Institute Book of Data Science](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome).

* **[github](https://github.com)** is used to version control and hosting
* **[Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)** is used for the write-up
* **[HackMD](https://hackmd.io)** is used as Markdown Editor thanks to its integration with `github` and its [`browser extensions`](https://hackmd.io/s/hackmd-it)
* **[jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/)** can be used to provide executable code
* **[binder](https://mybinder.org)** is enabled which allows in web execution of any jupyter notebook distributed with the `FAIR Cookbook`
* **[mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid)** javascript library is used to produce flowcharts, Gantt charts and pie charts used in the book.
