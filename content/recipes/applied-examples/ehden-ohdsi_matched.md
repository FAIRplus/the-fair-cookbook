## Main objectives

In this recipe, an example will be described on how to make observational health database (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_86 https://fairsharing.org/search?fairsharingRegistry=Database) s and observational studies
more Findable (notably the FAIR (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_88 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.WWI10U)  principles (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_87 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.WWI10U)  [F2](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/f2-data-described-rich-metadata/)
and [F4](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/f4-metadata-registered-indexed-searchable-resource/)) and
interoperability (principles [I1](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/i1-metadata-use-formal-accessible-shared-broadly-applicable-language-knowledge-representation/)
and [I2](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/i2-metadata-use-vocabularies-follow-fair-principles/)), by creating 
a metadata model (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_89 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=model_and_format)  and a human and machine readable website for dissemination of these resources. 

The output of the [COVID-19](https://www.ohdsi.org/covid-19-updates) [study-a-thon](https://www.thehyve.nl/articles/studyathon-multidisciplinary-collaboration-in-biomedical-open-science) 
(a OHD (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_91 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.bg7bb6) SI community [initiative](https://www.ohdsi.org/88-hours), involving the IMI [EHDEN](https://ehden.eu) project (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_90 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=project) ) 
held in March (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_92 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.52b22c)  2020, is used as proof-of-concept.

## Introduction

This recipe is based on work done on OMOP Common Data Model (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_97 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=model_and_format)  data as used during the Covid 19 Study-a-thon, a OHD (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_98 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.bg7bb6) SI
community initiative, organised in collaboration with the IMI EHDEN project (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_99 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=project) . The background informat (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_100 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=model_and_format) ion was previously
described in this [use case](https://fairtoolkit.pistoiaalliance.org/use-cases/fairifying-collaborative-research-on-real-world-data-the-hyve/)
on the Pistoia Alliance FAIR (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_101 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.WWI10U)  toolkit website, and also published in an EHDEN Deliverable, 
[D4.5 - Roadmap for interoperability](https://zenodo.org/record/4474373). 
Briefly, the IMI2 EHDEN project (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_102 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=project) 's main aim is to reduce the time to produce medical evidence for health outcomes 
research (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_103 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.52b22c)  and to do so, EHDEN has prioritized data harmonization at source.

However, data standard (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_104 https://fairsharing.org/search?fairsharingRegistry=Standard) ization and harmonization does not necessarily equate with FAIR (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_105 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.WWI10U)  data 
(see for example this [article](https://www.thehyve.nl/articles/data-quality-with-fair-principles)). 
This is where the interaction with the IMI2 FAIR (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_107 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.WWI10U) plus project (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_106 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=project)  can bring benefits.

The purpose of the present content is to highlight how to improve dataset Findability after the data harmonization
has taken place.

The methods described in this recipe are however generally applicable for observational health database (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_108 https://fairsharing.org/search?fairsharingRegistry=Database) s and studies,
not just data in the OMOP CDM (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_110 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.qk984b)  format (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_109 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=model_and_format) .

In March (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_111 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.52b22c)  2020 the OHD (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_112 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.bg7bb6) SI community organized a [study-a-thon focussed on COVID-19](https://www.ohdsi.org/ohdsi-news-updates/covid19-studyathon/),
which was aimed at addressing a number of key medical questions around CO (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_113 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.wgfrmg)  (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_114 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.thskvr) VID-19, such as predicting hospitalization
and drug safety and effectiveness. For this purpose, a large collection (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_116 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=collection)  of healthcare database (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_115 https://fairsharing.org/search?fairsharingRegistry=Database) s around the world were
investigated. Many important digital assets were produced during the [study-a-thon](https://ohdsi.org/ohdsi-kicks-off-international-collaborative-to-generate-real-world-evidence-on-covid-19-with-virtual-study-a-thon/),
such as study protocols, database (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_117 https://fairsharing.org/search?fairsharingRegistry=Database)  metadata and characterizations, study results, and publications. 

From the FAIR (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_119 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.WWI10U)  assessment performed in order to better understand the current state of FAIR (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_120 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.WWI10U) ness of studies and database (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_118 https://fairsharing.org/search?fairsharingRegistry=Database) s
used in OHD (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_123 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.bg7bb6) SI and in the CO (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_121 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.wgfrmg)  (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_122 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.thskvr) VID-19 study-a-thon in particular, it was found that there was room for improvement on both 
Findability and Reusability. Since increasing Findability was a common denominator for both studies and data sources, 
the main focus of the FAIR (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_124 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.WWI10U) ification was on developing structured metadata, specifically tailored for studies and data sources.

This recipe will describe a proof-of-concept that shows the step-by-step process of making resources more FAIR (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_125 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.WWI10U)  by:

*   Inventory and prioritisation of digital resources; 
*   Adding metadata to the resources using existing ontologies (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_126 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=terminology_artefact)  and defining new entities to make them findable by humans and machines;
*   Creating a website for FAIR (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_127 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.WWI10U)  dissemination of selected digital resources.

## Step-by-Step process

### Inventory and prioritization of digital resources

In order to start the FAIR (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_136 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.WWI10U) ification process of digital resources in OHD (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_137 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.bg7bb6) SI, it was important to take inventory of which 
kind of digital resources reside in the OHD (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_139 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.bg7bb6) SI ecosystem. Digital resources in OHD (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_140 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.bg7bb6) SI include for example the OMOP CDM (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_138 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.qk984b)  
itself, the OMOP Standard (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_141 https://fairsharing.org/search?fairsharingRegistry=Standard) ized Vocabularies (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_142 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.658tcg) , studies, cohort definitions and many more. 
Each digital resource itself can consist of multiple (sub) digital resources, as shown in {numref}`ehden-ohdsi-figure1`.

```
````


Prioritization of initial digital resources to FAIR (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_144 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.WWI10U) ify was important, as the OHD (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_145 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.bg7bb6) SI ecosystem is quite extensive.
In light of the study-a-thon on CO (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_146 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.wgfrmg)  (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_147 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.thskvr) VID-19 held in March (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_148 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.52b22c)  2020 by OHD (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_149 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.bg7bb6) SI and after a 
[community inventory](https://forums.ohdsi.org/t/implementing-the-fair-principles-in-the-ohdsi-approach-and-tools/10387),
studies and database (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_150 https://fairsharing.org/search?fairsharingRegistry=Database) s were selected as relevant digital resources to FAIR (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_151 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.WWI10U) ify, as these are important resources for the
research (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_154 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.52b22c) ers studying observational health data on CO (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_152 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.wgfrmg)  (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_153 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.thskvr) VID-19 and related topics. 


### Current status of database and study dissemination in OHDSI

**Database (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_155 https://fairsharing.org/search?fairsharingRegistry=Database) s in OHD (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_156 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.bg7bb6) SI**

General sources that provide informat (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_158 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=model_and_format) ion on observational health database (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_157 https://fairsharing.org/search?fairsharingRegistry=Database) s that are conformed to the OMOP CDM (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_159 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.qk984b)  are the
[data network page](https://www.ohdsi.org/web/wiki/doku.php?id=resources:2020_data_network), 
the [EMIF catalogue](https://emif-catalogue.eu/) and the [EHDEN Portal](https://portal.ehden.eu) (under development). 

The data network page of OHD (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_162 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.bg7bb6) SI shows some metadata on database (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_160 https://fairsharing.org/search?fairsharingRegistry=Database) s converted to the OMOP CDM (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_161 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.qk984b) .

The [EMIF catalogue](https://emif-catalogue.eu/) is developed (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_164 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.31385c)  by the European Medical Informat (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_163 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=model_and_format) ion Framework (EMIF) and
enables publishing and sharing of metadata on health data sources. Different consortia implementing the OMOP CDM (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_165 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.qk984b)  
disseminate metadata on database (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_166 https://fairsharing.org/search?fairsharingRegistry=Database) s in this catalogue. The EHDEN Portal builds on technology from the EMIF catalogue and
further expands this with functionality to compare database (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_167 https://fairsharing.org/search?fairsharingRegistry=Database) s and run studies in the network.

**Studies in OHD (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_168 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.bg7bb6) SI**

Studies are currently disseminated through [data.ohdsi.org](https://data.ohdsi.org/). This web page links to the study
results and [GitHub repositories of studies](https://github.com/ohdsi-studies) that are performed in the OHD (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_169 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.bg7bb6) SI community.
The web application [data.ohdsi.org/OhdsiStudies](https://data.ohdsi.org/OhdsiStudies/) gives an overview of all studies
in OHD (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_170 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.bg7bb6) SI with some associated metadata, such as study status, study leads and relevant dates.


### Defining a (semantic) model for relevant metadata elements

To increase the findability we captured the structured and rich metadata, by developing a semantic model (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_171 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=model_and_format)  in RDF (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_172 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.p77ph9)  for the
observational studies and database (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_173 https://fairsharing.org/search?fairsharingRegistry=Database) s. The model (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_175 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=model_and_format)  contained all relevant metadata elements for studies, database (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_174 https://fairsharing.org/search?fairsharingRegistry=Database) s, as well
as persons associated with those studies and database (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_176 https://fairsharing.org/search?fairsharingRegistry=Database) s. 

Model (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_177 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=model_and_format) ling metadata elements in RDF (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_178 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.p77ph9)  has the advantage that the metadata elements are properly semantically described,
structured and linked. In addition, RDF (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_179 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.p77ph9)  is easily expandable and modifiable. 

The Turtle (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_182 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.3e194c)  serialization format (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_180 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=model_and_format)  was chosen as the RDF (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_183 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.p77ph9)  format (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_181 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=model_and_format) . Metadata elements were defined and map (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_184 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.53edcc) ped (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_185 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.31385c)  to 
[Schema.org](http://schema.org) types and properties. Schema.org (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_186 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.hzdzq8)  is a vocabulary that can be used to create structured
data on the internet and to make the data discoverable. 

Relevant Schema.org (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_188 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.hzdzq8)  types for studies and database (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_187 https://fairsharing.org/search?fairsharingRegistry=Database) s included: 

*   [Dataset](https://schema.org/Dataset): represents a data file or database (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_189 https://fairsharing.org/search?fairsharingRegistry=Database)  resulting from the study
*   [MedicalObservationalStudy](https://schema.org/MedicalObservationalStudy): main type that represents the medical study itself
*   [MedicalObservationalStudyDesign](https://schema.org/MedicalObservationalStudyDesign): provides details about the design of the study
*   [MedicalStudyStatus](https://schema.org/MedicalStudyStatus): provides the status of the study (although this is based on clinical trials, and observational studies will not use all statuses)
*   [MedicalCondition](https://schema.org/MedicalCondition): used to link the study to the specific medical condition(s) it covers
*   [Drug](https://schema.org/Drug): used to link the study to any pharmaceutical products it covers
*   [Organization](https://schema.org/Organization): represents an organization, such as a university
*   [Person](https://schema.org/Person): represents a person and is mainly used to indicate the authors of / research (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_190 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.52b22c) ers involved in the study

### OHDSI extension to Schema.org vocabulary

[Schema.org](https://schema.org/) is a general purpose vocabulary for search (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_202 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.52b22c) ing entities on the internet, so metadata
elements specific for some OHD (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_203 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.bg7bb6) SI assets were not present. To be able to capture metadata as extensive as necessary,
custom types and properties had to be created. These included: 

*   Properties specific for OHD (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_204 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.bg7bb6) SI studies(e.g. study types and study use cases)
*   Database (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_205 https://fairsharing.org/search?fairsharingRegistry=Database)  properties (e.g. database (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_206 https://fairsharing.org/search?fairsharingRegistry=Database)  characteristics and population size) 
*   Author properties (e.g. GitHub (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_207 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.c55d5e)  handle (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_208 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.0b7e54)  and forum profile). 

The resulting metadata model (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_209 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=model_and_format)  was shared in a public [GitHub repository](https://github.com/thehyve/ohdsi-schemas/blob/d18a9a924cd13fc4525b5965e6ecb43c5d22a333/models/ohdsi_model/ohdsi_semantic_model.ttl).

For OHD (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_210 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.bg7bb6) SI specific types and properties the namespace [http://data.ohdsi.org/](http://data.ohdsi.org/) is used, using the `ohdsi` prefix. 

The RDF (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_212 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.p77ph9)  model (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_211 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=model_and_format)  was validated using Apache Jena RIOT (version 3.15.0), using the following command:

```bash
riot.bat --validate ohdsi_semantic_model.ttl
```


### Metadata capture using YAML

In principle, the RDF (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_214 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.p77ph9)  classes defined in the above Turtle (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_213 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.3e194c)  file can directly be used to set up the JSON (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_215 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.5bbab9) -LD (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_216 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.8f9bbb)  file needed 
for the website metadata. But in this example, we used an extra step by first capturing the metadata of studies, 
database (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_217 https://fairsharing.org/search?fairsharingRegistry=Database) s and authors, in the more data entry friendly YAML format (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_218 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=model_and_format) . The YAML format (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_219 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=model_and_format)  can be annotated with comments
to guide the person submitting their metadata. 

The following figure shows the metadata in Turtle (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_220 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.3e194c)  and in YAML. YAML uses slightly different wording and syntax, 
to make it easier for end users / science bloggers to understand what kind of metadata is expected to be filled in. 

In YAML, the data looks like this:

```yaml
# Study identifier, specifically created for the website.
# The identifier is the last part of the URL directing to the particular study
study_id: â€˜Covid19Icariusâ€™
# Analytics Use Case of the Study, choose 0, 1, 2 or 3:
# 0: Characterization
# 1: Population-Level Estimation
# 2: Patient-Level Prediction
# 3: Characterization and Population-Level Estimation
study_usecase: [1]
# Conditions studied; if multiple conditions are being studied,
# duplicate all keys under "conditions"
conditions:
- concept_name: "Disease caused by 2019-nCoV"
  concept_id: "37311061"
  code:
    concept_code: "840539006"
    vocabulary_id: "SNOMED CT"
    concept_code_url: "http://snomed.info/id/840539006"
# Drug studied; if multiple subjects are being studied,
# duplicate all keys under "study_subject"
study_subject:
- concept_name: "quinaprilat"
  concept_id: "45775375"
  code:
    concept_code: "1546359"
    vocabulary_id: "RxNorm"
    concept_code_url: "http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/RXNORM/1546359"
```

The data in YAML gets converted into Turtle (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_221 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.3e194c)  programatically:

```text
@prefix ohdsi: <http://data.ohdsi.org/> .

The Hugo backend that we created, reads in the study articles, including the YAML metadata, and produces an HTML (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_222 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.YugnuL)  output
from that which contains the article text but also embeds the entered metadata as JSON (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_223 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.5bbab9) -LD (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_224 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.8f9bbb)  
(see {numref}`ehden-ohdsi-figure3`). In order to do this, we have written custom processing logic that takes the YAML 
data as input and format (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_226 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=model_and_format) s this into RDF (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_227 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.p77ph9)  in accordance with the metadata model (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_225 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=model_and_format) .

### Embedding the metadata in the website as JSON-LD

JSON (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_240 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.5bbab9) -LD (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_241 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.8f9bbb)  is a format (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_236 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=model_and_format)  for structured and linked data and, like Turtle (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_238 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.3e194c) , a serialization format (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_237 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=model_and_format)  of RDF (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_239 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.p77ph9) . 

It can be embedded in the HTML (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_242 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.YugnuL)  code in the back end of a website. Search (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_243 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.52b22c)  engines like Google 
(including [Google dataset search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/)) use this structured data to find 
and understand the data. Understanding the data goes hand in hand with using the [Schema.org](http://schema.org) 
vocabulary, because annotating metadata with Schema.org (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_244 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.hzdzq8)  types and properties gives meaning to the data. 
This search (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_245 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.52b22c)  engine optimization (SEO, see the [Search Engine optimization recipe](https://w3id.org/faircookbook/FCB010)) 
enables better Findability of the data.

For this proof-of-concept project (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_246 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=project) , a website was created for dissemination of metadata on studies, 
database (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_247 https://fairsharing.org/search?fairsharingRegistry=Database) s and authors, generated and used during the OHD (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_251 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.bg7bb6) SI CO (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_249 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.wgfrmg)  (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_250 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.thskvr) VID-19 "study-a-thon". Metadata on studies, database (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_248 https://fairsharing.org/search?fairsharingRegistry=Database) s and
authors is displayed on this [website](https://covid19.ohdsi.app/), and is embedded as JSON (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_252 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.5bbab9) -LD (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_253 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.8f9bbb)  in the HTML (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_254 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.YugnuL)  code as well.
<!-- TODO: Give example of a page with markup -->

Embedding metadata in JSON (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_255 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.5bbab9) -LD (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_256 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.8f9bbb)  in HTML (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_257 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.YugnuL)  will enable web crawlers to scrape the metadata and will increase Findability 
by search (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_258 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.52b22c)  engines. When for example querying 
[https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/),
the data should pop up when JSON (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_259 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.5bbab9) -LD (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_260 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.8f9bbb)  is embedded, but only when the `schema:Dataset` class is included
(see also the next section for details on this).


### Making a sitemap file and letting crawlers know

Setting up a `robots.txt` file at the root of a website will give search (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_261 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.52b22c)  engine crawlers a guide on which web pages can
be crawled, and which pages canâ€™t be crawled. Crawling all pages is possible by adding this line to the `robots.txt` file:

```text
User-agent: *
```

The Hugo framework automatically generates a sitemap (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_262 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.53edcc)  when building a website 
(in this example: [https://covid19.ohdsi.app/sitemap.xml](https://covid19.ohdsi.app/sitemap.xml))

The generated JSON (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_263 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.5bbab9) -LD (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_264 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.8f9bbb)  files can be validated using [Googleâ€™s Rich Result Test](https://search.google.com/test/rich-results).
This tool can easily validate JSON (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_265 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.5bbab9) -LD (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_269 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.8f9bbb)  code, by either submitting a URL (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_268 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.9d38e2)  directing to the JSON (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_266 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.5bbab9) -LD (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_270 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.8f9bbb) , or by pasting JSON (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_267 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.5bbab9) -LD (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_271 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.8f9bbb)  code.
<!-- TODO give an example link to a page being validated -->

An important note to make here is that to make the data findable for Google Dataset search (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_273 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.52b22c)  the model (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_272 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=model_and_format)  and final
JSON (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_274 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.5bbab9) -LD (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_275 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.8f9bbb)  markup needed to mention the `schema:Dataset` class. In a first iteration, we had used our new 
`ohdsi:database (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_276 https://fairsharing.org/search?fairsharingRegistry=Database) ` class and the website was not found (even if the `ohdsi:database (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_277 https://fairsharing.org/search?fairsharingRegistry=Database)  is-a schema:Dataset` statement from
the model (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_278 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=model_and_format)  is repeated in the JSON (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_279 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.5bbab9) -LD (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_280 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.8f9bbb) ; 
Google's Schema.org (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_283 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.hzdzq8)  tools used a fixed context file, ignoring any additional statements included in your own JSON (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_281 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.5bbab9) -LD (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_282 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.8f9bbb) ).

To illustrate, the JSON (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_284 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.5bbab9) -LD (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_285 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.8f9bbb)  representation of metadata instantiation of the OHD (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_286 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.bg7bb6) SI Covid19 Icarius study looks like this in
JSON (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_289 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.5bbab9) -LD (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_290 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.8f9bbb)  (compare the metadata presented above in YAML and Turtle (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_288 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.3e194c)  format (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_287 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=model_and_format) ):

### Generate final website version using HUGO

The static site generator [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/) was used to create the 
[covid19.ohdsi.app](https://covid19.ohdsi.app/) website. To populate the website with metadata, so-called
[archetypes](https://gohugo.io/content-management/archetypes/) were created. These arch (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_291 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.52b22c) etypes are content templates 
that use the YAML format (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_292 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=model_and_format) , as the JSON (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_295 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.5bbab9) -LD (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_296 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.8f9bbb)  format (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_293 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=model_and_format)  is not the easiest format (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_294 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=model_and_format)  to enter data, to manually populate the static
website pages with metadata. Hence, these arch (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_297 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.52b22c) etype templates are used for metadata instantiation of the website. 
(see the previous sections of this recipe). 

Part of the content is populated automatically, by scraping informat (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_298 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=model_and_format) ion from the 
[OHDSI forum](https://forums.ohdsi.org/) and [README files](https://github.com/ohdsi-studies/StudyRepoTemplate) in the 
study-specific GitHub (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_302 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.c55d5e)  repositories (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_299 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=repository) . The metadata in YAML is converted to JSON (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_300 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.5bbab9) -LD (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_301 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.8f9bbb)  in the back end of the website. 
In the front end of the website, this metadata is shown in a human-readable way. 

The source code of the website can be found on [https://github.com/thehyve/ohdsi-covid19-site](https://github.com/thehyve/ohdsi-covid19-site). 


### Final result

The final result of applying all these steps looks like this: an HTML (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_305 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.YugnuL)  page in the browser with JSON (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_303 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.5bbab9) -LD (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_304 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.8f9bbb)  metadata under
the hood. 
A screenshot of the HTML (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_306 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.YugnuL)  page is presented in {numref}`ehden-ohdsi-figure6`.

informat (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_319 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=model_and_format) ion payload and makes it available to search (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_320 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.52b22c)  enginesâ€™ crawlers.

Finally, with all this in place, one may now use the dedicated Google Dataset Search (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_321 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.52b22c)  site to discover new covid-related

## Conclusion

The key reusable element in this recipe is the use of Schema.org (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_333 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.hzdzq8)  JSON (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_331 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.5bbab9) -LD (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_332 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.8f9bbb)  statements in any website to promote
findability of metadata in search (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_334 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.52b22c)  engines. Using the Hugo site generator has the advantage that it is very versatile
and includes a lot of scientific/blogging authoring tools out of the box. 
However, the particular implementation of using YAML as input format (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_335 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=model_and_format)  (which is â€˜canonical Hugoâ€™) and converting this 
during the static website generation process to JSON (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_336 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.5bbab9) -LD (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_337 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.8f9bbb)  is quite laborious and also potentially introduces issues during
the conversion. Therefore, it is probably easier and more scalable to let the scientists write their metadata directly
in JSON (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_338 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.5bbab9) -LD (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_339 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.8f9bbb) , helped (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_340 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.31385c)  by some good examples and templates, and the Hugo software could even be extended to facilitate 
that as well.

Another next step that could be taken, besides publishing the JSON (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_341 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.5bbab9) -LD (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_342 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.8f9bbb)  metadata directly on the web, is to wrap it 
into a container such as [RO-CRATE](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/) and publish these directly into a 
scientific artefact repository (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_343 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=repository) . This would also help to sustain the availability of the data, because for all its
great properties, static websites only live as long as the web-host stays up, and the average website disappears after
a few years. 
Hosting the website on [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) and using a pinning service could be yet another remedy to fix this
problem, but this is out of scope of this recipe.
