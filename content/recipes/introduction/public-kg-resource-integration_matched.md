## Main Objectives

In the following sections, we will cover the following topics:

1. the known reference knowledge graphs to integrate with.
2. the different scientific contexts.
3. the impact for Pharma industry and EFPIA more broadly.

## Introduction

When it comes to research (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.52b22c)  carried out by academic and industry ventures such as the Innovative Medicine Initiative of these European Union, three main scenarios can be outlined:

- Identification of new drug targets, as it the case for the [IMI Resolute](https://www.imi.europa.eu/projects-results/project-factsheets/resolute) project (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=project)  for instance, which focuses on
characterizing solute carriers and identifying potential candidates for "druggability".
- Development of new therapeutic products and techniques given a specific disease area, as in the [IMI AETIONOMY](https://www.imi.europa.eu/projects-results/project-factsheets/aetionomy) project (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=project) .
- Discovery of new drugs against pathogens as for instance the [New Drugs for Bad Bugs (ND4BB)](https://www.imi.europa.eu/projects-results/project-factsheets/nd4bb) project (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=project) .

This gives a backdrop against which work to enhance interoperability of data generated by these project (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=project) s needs to be aware of the existing (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.q7bkqr)  data landscape.

The purpose of the present content type is to provide a basic survey of the existing (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.q7bkqr) , and the relevance to specific research (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.52b22c)  contexts and tasks. This informat (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=model_and_format) ion may be useful when deciding on particular technical aspects such as choice of data interface, choice of terminology (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=terminology_artefact)  and controlled terminologies (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=terminology_artefact)  or, choice of data format (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=model_and_format) s.

We therefore focus the dataset scan on main entities such as Drugs / Chemicals and Disease / Clinical Research (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.52b22c)  Data. Such datasets are popularly known as Knowledge Graphs (KGs).

Additionally, the availability of such informat (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=model_and_format) ion in specialized graph representations was also included as a selection criteria. Therefore, services providing SP (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.s63y3p) ARQL (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.87ccfd)  endpoint and Graph API for dataset access were considered and the following sections providing specific informat (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=model_and_format) ion and references for each of the resources and datasets are considered


## A catalog of SPARQL Endpoints for Life Sciences: Yummydata

Yummydata is a catalog of SP (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.s63y3p) ARQL (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.87ccfd)  endpoints of interest to the biomedical community, maintained by the Database (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM https://fairsharing.org/search?fairsharingRegistry=Database)  Center for Life Sciences in Kashiwa, Japan {footcite}`pmid29688370`. 

Database (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM https://fairsharing.org/search?fairsharingRegistry=Database)  URL (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.9d38e2) : http://yummydata.org/

The resource can be viewed as a registry to resources as well as a monitoring services, which regularly checks the "health status" of the resources it indexes.

The "health status" is reported as a "Umaka Score (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.m283c)  (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.xMmOCL) " which consolidates endpoint status according to six dimensions (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.9af33c) :
**Availability, Freshness, Operation, Usefulness, Validity, and Performance**.

It should be noted that Yummydata does not differentiate between semantic artefacts, such as an ontology (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=terminology_artefact) , or a dataset
represented in RDF (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.p77ph9) Linked data. 

The authors of the resource highlight this point and underline that being able to disting (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.q7bkqr) uish between these types of graph explicitly may be required in the future.

## Resources for Druggable Targets Predictions


### 1. OpenTarget

The [OpenTarget project](https://www.opentargets.org/) is a public private partnership aiming at providing a 
central resource based on public domain data to enable target identification and prioritisation, based on functional genomics data and GWAS (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.ubYn8D)  data {footcite}`10.1093/nar/gkaa1027`. 

Using a genome wide, evidence based approach, the OpenTarget project (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=project)  offers the possibility to obtain reliable informat (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=model_and_format) ion
about validated targets against which design active compounds. Such approach has been shown to yield higher success in progressing potential therapeutic compounds along the clinical trial pipeline.

All the data generated by the OpenTarget project (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=project)  is available for download and is accessible via 
* a GraphQL application programming interface. https://api.genetics.opentargets.org/graphql
* a Google Big Query interface. https://platform-docs.opentargets.org/data-access/google-bigquery
* a ftp download. https://platform.opentargets.org (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.3f9n4y) /downloads/data

More recently, the dataset is also available from Amazon Web Services

### 7. AstraZeneca Biological Insights Knowledge Graph BIKG

The BIKG is a resource developed (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.31385c)  by AstraZeneca to combine both public and internal data to facilitate knowledge discovery using machine learning over KG.

To build it, AstraZeneca developers created dedicated informat (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=model_and_format) ion extraction pipeline for mining unstructured text such as full text publications using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, as well as informat (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=model_and_format) ion obtained from specialized database (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM https://fairsharing.org/search?fairsharingRegistry=Database) s such as ChEMB (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.a1rp4c) L (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.m3jtpg)  (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.m3jtpg)  or Ensembl (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.fx0mw7)  (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.fx0mw7)  for chemical and gene products respectively, but also other datasets such as Hetionet and Open Target.

The latest version of the BIKG consists of 10.9m nodes (of 22 types) and over 118 million unique edges (of 59 types, forming 398 different triples)" {footcite}`Geleta2021.10.28.466262`.

Interesting (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.q7bkqr) ly, the BIKG pipelines also allow third-party datasets to be integrated. This step involves an ETL into the BIKG semantic model (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=model_and_format)  and the BIKG upper ontology (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=terminology_artefact)  (BIKG ULO).

For integration purpose, the BIKG ULO is compatible with ontologies (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=terminology_artefact)  such as:
* UBERO (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.nwgynk)  (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.9w8ea0)  (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.504c6c)  (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.cp0ybc) N (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.4c0b6b) : for anatomical terms
* GO (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.6xq0ee) :  Gene Ontology (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=terminology_artefact)  (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.6xq0ee)  for Biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions.


BIKG can be accessed via a GraphQL API and the underlying data can be exported in 2 different graph format (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=model_and_format) s, RDF (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.p77ph9)  or Neo4j/CSV (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.1943d4)  for linked data graph or property graph representations respectively.

Interesting (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.q7bkqr) ly, two use cases for using the BIKG are discussed in the associated publications and clearly outline FAIR (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.WWI10U) ification goals. These use cases are:

## PyKEEN

PyKEE (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.0b711a) N (Python KnowlEdge EmbeddiNgs) is a Python package designed to train and evaluate knowledge graph embedding model (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=model_and_format) s (KGEM) (incorporating multi-modal informat (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=model_and_format) ion) {footcite}`pmid34735335`, {footcite}`pmid30768158`.

GitHub (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.c55d5e)  (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.c55d5e)  Repository (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=repository) : https://github.com (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.c55d5e) /pykeen/pykeen

So, as such, PyKEE (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.0b711a) N is more a tool than a KG, however PyKEE (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.0b711a) N contains many reference KGs and datasets which can be used for a variety of data science tasks and machine learning applications. PyKEE (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.0b711a) N is mainly geared towards helping developers train KGEM for tasks such as link prediction.

The following figure shows a snippet of the various KGs available from the python package.

This is one of the main reason why we mention this library as it provides a context to data integration scenarios along with the datasets and tooling to do so.

```python
from pykeen.pipeline import pipeline

result = pipeline(
    model='TransE',
    dataset='nations',
)
```

To see an example of how to use the library, we highly recommended reading the [Medium blog post](https://towardsdatascience.com/knowledge-graph-completion-with-pykeen-and-neo4j-6bca734edf43) and consult the associated jupyter notebook (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.cbz72b) , which shows how to use your own dataset, understand the evaluation, and make novel link predictions:

## Conclusion

With this recipe, the intent was to raise awareness in the wealth of Life Science informat (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=model_and_format) ion available as Knowledge Graph and ongoing integrative efforts.
We have also tried to convey informat (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=model_and_format) ion about the license for each of the resources as well as some insights into the curation protocols specific to each the KG.
Finally, we wanted to highlight how some KGs are already used to train model (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=model_and_format) s and make predictions in the context of drug repurposing for instance. 
This is of particular interest in the context of the Innovative Medicine Initiative but not only, obviously.
It certainly should provide food for thoughts when engaging with a FAIR (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.WWI10U) ification process and should help define FAIR (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.WWI10U) ification goals as well as the process to perform in order to be able to be compatible with specific resources for a specific task at hand.
