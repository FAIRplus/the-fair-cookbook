This document aims to identify the values underlying or correlated with the FAIR (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_7313 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.WWI10U)  principles (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_7312 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.WWI10U)  (whether they are based on ethics principles or other valuable grounds) that could be considered when data providers choose to engage in making their data or part of them FAIR (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_7314 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.WWI10U) . Legal measures are also included insofar as there are certain legal rules that must be respected, that are based on fundamental rights.

The list, non-exhaustive, is oriented towards answering the following question: “Why to share or re-use data?” [and as a first step in this process, “Why FAIR (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_7315 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.WWI10U) ify data?”]. 

As there will be project (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_7316 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=project) s related to different subjects and/or with different kinds of datasets and different stakeholders involved, the FAIR (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_7317 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.WWI10U) ification of some of the data sets could rely on values that are not yet listed here. In that respect, all data providers, partners and participants of FAIR (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_7318 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.WWI10U) plus and stakeholders are invited to discuss and add any other motivations they have to make data FAIR (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_7319 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.WWI10U) . 



## Values underlying FAIR principles


### 1. Values correlated with the FINDABLE character: universality and recognition of research


- **Better and more inclusive research (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_7320 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.52b22c) **: Findable data help overcoming barriers to data sharing among research (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_7321 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.52b22c)  communities, facilitating data access and data re-use. 

- **Transparency**: to make data findable, data providers have to give informat (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_7322 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=model_and_format) ion on the origin, process and sharing process of their FAIR (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_7323 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.WWI10U)  data (metadata).  

- **Sustainability**: facilitating the replication of studies for validation and avoiding unnecessary duplication, FAIR (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_7324 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.WWI10U)  data reduces monetary and energy costs linked to the production of data, helping to preserve a good environment for present and future generations. 

- **Efficiency**: the inclusion of data in FAIR (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_7325 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.WWI10U) plus reduces the costs of medical research (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_7329 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.52b22c)  and makes medical technologies/innovations more affordable. This could represent a mutual benefit between data providers and the scientific community (FAIR (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_7326 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.WWI10U)  data users). In the first case, FAIR (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_7327 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.WWI10U)  data can for instance enable data providers expand their influence into new territories (beneficence) and, in the second one, FAIR (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_7328 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.WWI10U)  data users can reuse data that in another way it would be too demanding to obtain.  

- **Recognition of work**; legitimacy of a number of tasks: by making data more visible the work of quality data production becomes more recognized, whereas it can be more neglected as an achievement or a research (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_7330 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.52b22c)  output if data are not findable.


**Legal measures**: data sets must respect professional secret rules and data pseudonymization must be ensured to preserve individuals’ privacy and data confidentiality. If pseudonymization is not possible, it is required to obtain explicit, informed consent of all data participants. This consent has to be also documented. Data providers must also verify there are no rules related to classified informat (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_7331 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=model_and_format) ion that can be applicable to these data.   



### 2. Values correlated with the ACCESSIBLE character: Responsibility


- **Accountability**:  Accessible data give the opportunity for data providers to organise a fair and clear distribution of responsibilities along the data re-use chain. Data providers must adopt efficient mechanisms to make these rules applicable.

- **Trust**: data providers can only make their data accessible on the background of trust between them, patients, data users and medical community.  

- **Common good**: data providers may share their data in the aim to reflect openness to scientific community and general public to achieve a common good through knowledge. 

- **Health as a value**: Provision of a better health service (human well-being): data can be made accessible with the purpose of facilitating the development of safer technologies and of achieving a better patient care in general (public health). Linked to the value principle, the aim is to redesign health care delivery systems to maximize care value for patients.




### 3. Values correlated with the INTEROPERABLE character: Universality and equity


- **Non-discrimination regarding access to data**: Interoperable data can contribute to equal access to knowledge and to equal advantages that data can offer. This can also facilitate distribution of benefits and opportunities particularly with respect to disadvantaged scientific or societal groups (i.e. due to economic, technical, or geographic disadvantages…). 

- **Reproducibility**: Essential verification and reproduction of results rely on interoperability of data. Facilitation of use of technical and organizational solutions available is a plus and avoids waste. 

- **Novelty**: new questions can be asked when interoperability of data provide large sample size.

- **Quality**: improvement of quality of results through interoperability of data. 


### 4.  Values correlated with the REUSABLE character: a sense of eternity!


- **Reciprocity**: data providers can make their data re-usable and in consequence receive recognition by the scientific community and/or the general public of their contribution beyond their initial expectation, as multiple uses increase the data impact. 

- **Benefit sharing**: making good quality data re-used is increasing the benefit in terms of research (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_7332 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.52b22c)  output of the efforts to generate these data, and multiple publications will come out of the (re) use of the same data..

- **Non maleficence**: as respect of privacy and data protection are part of the requirements for re-use of data, the “non nocere” principle is at the heart of the system. FAIR (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_7334 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.WWI10U)  data must at the same time ensure individuals’ rights related to privacy and data protection and promote a societal good associated to research (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_7335 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.52b22c)  use for the benefit of society (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_7333 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=society) . 

- **Long term view and generosity**: data re-use gives a temporal dimension to the original work done to produce the data that tends towards eternity.

- **Freedom of research (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_7336 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.52b22c) **: by allowing data to be re-used for multiple research (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_7337 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.52b22c) es that might otherwise be impossible, the freedom of research (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_7338 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.52b22c)  is enhanced.

- **Legitimacy of research (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_7340 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.52b22c) **: the potential for re-use of data can be considered as a possibility to increase the legitimacy of an initial research (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_7341 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.52b22c)  and its place in society (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_7339 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=society) .

- **Human dignity and respect for human autonomy**: making data reused can facilitate respect for the dignity of every human person. The principle of autonomy implies the respect of human freedom. In that sense, it implies that individuals have to be able to decide if they want to share or not their data. It also means that individuals have to be aware of the terms of collection (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_7342 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=collection)  and of sharing data process, the purposes of data sharing, and that they can withdraw their consent anytime. At the same time being aware of multiple research (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_7343 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.52b22c)  uses can give a perception of a higher societal importance of their participation in research (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_7344 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.52b22c) . 


**Legal measures**: The reuse of data has to respect all restrictions expressed by data subjects, compliance with the initial informat (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_7346 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=model_and_format) ion and consent given by the participant has to be achieved, and participants’ data protection rights have to be guaranteed. In addition, the data provider must define policies (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_7345 https://fairsharing.org/search?fairsharingRegistry=Policy)  ruling the access and use of data sets that must be respected by data users. All parties must assure the respect of the data provider license (and FAIR (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_7347 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.WWI10U) plus objectives). 
 

A lot has been written about the values underpinning data sharing but little has been done to explicit values underpinning each of the FAIR (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_7349 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.WWI10U)  principles (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_7348 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.WWI10U) . This work and the contribution to it of the FAIR (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_7350 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.WWI10U) plus consortium and participants may help constructing an original value framework.
