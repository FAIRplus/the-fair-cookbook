## Introduction

The goal of this section is to go over each of the principles for FAIR data management as described by Wilkinson and coworkers in their Nature Springer Scientific Data manuscript published in 2016
<!-- {cite}`Wilkinson2016FAIR,Wilkinson2019Evaluation`. -->
Owing to the success of the principles, now endorsed by funding agencies (IMI, Wellcome Trust to name only two), but also by the G20 and by industry leaders, it is essential to remind the reader about those.

## The FAIR principles and FAIRplus

The principles will be the organizing principle for the FAIR (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_9489 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.WWI10U) plus Cookbook (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_9487 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.cbz72b) . While the book (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_9488 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.cbz72b)  itself can be search (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_9490 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.52b22c)  in
various ways and its content exposed through a number of angles, personas and facets, 
the main `Table of Content` organizes a number of atomic recipes around of the principles and their associated sub themes.

## Conclusions

This section should be seen as a refresher for anyone unclear about the FAIR (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_9492 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.WWI10U)  principles (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_9491 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.WWI10U) . 
Now that key background informat (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_9493 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=model_and_format) ion has been provided, shining a light on a number of ethical issues driving 
both the development and implementation of the FAIR (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_9495 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.WWI10U)  principles (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_9494 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.WWI10U)  in the context of Life Science data
as well as learning about the overall FAIR (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_9496 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.WWI10U) ification process represent a natural progression 
in the content of the FAIR (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_9498 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.WWI10U)  Cookbook (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_9497 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.cbz72b) .
