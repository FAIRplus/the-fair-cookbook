# Findability

+++
---

Metadata and data should be discoverable by both humans and machines. 

To be Findable any data object should be uniquely and persistently identifiable:
- The same data object should be re-findable at any point in time, thus data objects should be persistent, with emphasis on their metadata.
- A data object should minimally contain basic machine actionable metadata that allows it to be distinguished from other data objects.
- Identifiers for any concept used in data objects should therefore be unique and persistent.

This chapter is dedicated to the `identifiers`, `standards`, and `services`, and other `resources` necessary to enable and improve data discoverability by machines.
