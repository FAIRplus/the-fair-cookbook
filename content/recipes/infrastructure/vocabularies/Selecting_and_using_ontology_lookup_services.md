## Main Objective: introduction to ontology lookup services

This recipe provides guidance on the selection and exploitation of ontology lookup services. An ‘ontology lookup service’ refers to **any type of application, standalone or Web-based, that enables the use of existing ontologies to support knowledge formalization and sharing, by fostering ontology-based descriptions of knowledge**. Tools useful to build, edit or maintain ontologies are not considered ontology lookup services and thus are out of the scope of this recipe. 

In essence, an ontology lookup service is a platform that provides users with the possibility to **search in a set of ontologies, the most suitable concepts to describe the semantics of a piece of knowledge of interest, usually available in the form of one or more keywords or a text excerpt**. Most ontology lookup services are available as Web applications: most of them also support programmatic access to their capabilities by means of (REST) APIs. Ontology lookup services can vary in the features that are provided, but often include:



*   **Complex searching for concepts of interest**: most services implement advanced search features (i.e. scoping the search to specific ontologies or to specific parts of an ontology) or allow users to specify fine-grained patterns to aggregate or restrict the scope of search results.
*   **Advanced browsing capabilities**, to explore the contents of a specific ontology by means of custom data navigation widgets such as tree-based views.
*   **Managing distinct versions **of an ontology and alert its users when specific concepts become obsolete. 
*   **Importing** user-provided ontologies, giving consumers the ability to leverage a service for other terminologies beyond those included.
*   Programmatic means to **access and deploy instances of the ontology lookup service in the premises of its users** represents another differentiating feature, using relevant documentation.
*   **Recommending **ontologies based on the input of a given term, with ontologies ranked according to custom-weighted criteria.
*   Access to an active **user community **that supports and exploits a specific ontology lookup service, serving as an indication of widespread adoption and selection.
This recipe presents guidelines and relevant considerations when choosing an ontology lookup service, followed by overview of existing public ontology lookup services and a comparison of their core features.


## 2. Selecting An Ontology Lookup Service

This section provides guidelines and suggestions on how to select and leverage an ontology lookup service, on the basis of the knowledge needs and ontology use patterns that characterize a specific knowledge-intensive project. Several aspects to consider when choosing an ontology lookup service are derived based on a series of commonly asked questions;



*   **Is the set of ontologies incorporated in the ontology lookup service <span style="text-decoration:underline;">suitable to formally describe the knowledge domain my project is interested in</span>?**

    Ontology lookup services usually provide access and enable users to search and reference classes and properties of _a specific set of ontologies related to a specific knowledge domain_ (i.e. biomedical knowledge). When choosing an ontology lookup service it is important to verify whether the ontologies covered by a specific service are suitable to describe the content of our knowledge-intensive project. Besides a list of the ontologies covered, and interactive widgets to explore such ontologies (e.g. tree-based views), some ontology lookup services also provide _ontology recommendation capabilities:_ given some “sample” (i.e. text excerpt or list of keywords) of the knowledge we need to describe by means of available ontologies, the ontology lookup service ‘recommender’ suggests which are the best ontologies to use to this propose.

*   **Do I need to <span style="text-decoration:underline;">consider / rely on private ontologies in my project</span>? Do I need to <span style="text-decoration:underline;">use ontologies that are not already imported and thus available</span> in the ontology lookup service of my choice?**

    Some ontology lookup services enable users to import external (i.e. user-provided) ontologies in order to incorporate the content of these ontologies in their search and recommendation capabilities. This feature could represent a key factor to consider when choosing an ontology lookup service since several knowledge-intensive projects rely on private ontologies or need to consider a set of additional ontologies not natively covered by a specific ontology lookup service.

*   **Because of data privacy or data protection issues, do I need to <span style="text-decoration:underline;">use an instance of the ontology lookup service that is deployed locally on my private computing infrastructure</span>?**

    Several ontology lookup services provide the possibility to deploy the service on the private computing infrastructure of its users. This feature would be particularly relevant when private ontologies are adopted in a knowledge-intensive project.

*   **Which are the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">usage patterns I will rely on in order to exploit the ontology lookup service</span>? Will the 1) <span style="text-decoration:underline;">massive and systematic exploitation of the ontology search, 2) the recommendation features</span> of the ontology lookup service or 3) the integration of its capabilities in more complex systems, require the possibility to programmatically access the service by means of an application programming interface (API)?**

    Ontology lookup services usually provide a (Web-based) user interface as the preferred way to interact with them to browse and search for ontologies, or recommend relevant concepts to describe contents of interest. In several scenarios, the possibility to programmatically interact with ontology lookup services would be extremely valuable; to this purpose, several ontology lookup services implement an API (mostly based on REST interactions) that enable the user to programmatically invoke the majority of ontology search features of the same service. In order to simplify the integration of the ontology lookup service support into external applications, several ontology lookup services provide users with language-specific clients to interact with them through their API. 

*   **Is the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">distribution license</span> of the ontology lookup service compatible with the way I plan to exploit the features provided the same service in my project or with the way I plan to integrate the same service in my project?**

    The licencing terms of the ontology lookup service of choice intended for use in a given context and knowledge-intensive project, is a key consideration when selecting an ontology lookup service: available ontology lookup services range from open-source applications to commercial tools and it is best to choose one with funding in mind.

*   **Does the ontology lookup service manage <span style="text-decoration:underline;">ontology versioning and updates</span> so that I can easily reflect any ontology update into my knowledge-intensive project? **

    Ontologies and terminologies usually evolve over time: when a new, updated version of an ontology used in a knowledge-intensive project becomes available, best practice suggests that we should also update the part of our projects that rely on such ontology. Some ontology lookup services implement specific procedures and tools to manage and propagate ontology updates; the availability of such tools would simplify the implementation of changes deriving from ontology updates in the projects under consideration.

*   **Is the ontology lookup service <span style="text-decoration:underline;">supported by an active community of developers or by an active company</span>? Which are the available channels I can rely on to <span style="text-decoration:underline;">receive support</span> on the usage and integration of the ontology lookup service?**

    The support of an active community of developers and users is a key aspect to take into account when choosing an ontology lookup service. This could be quantified by evaluating several factors of an ontology lookup service including: (i) availability of mailing or support lists; (ii) for open-source projects, using metrics such as the star-rating, the number of forks and followers and the frequency of commits of the project on the code-sharing platform used (e.g. GitHub); (iii) size of the community of users of the ontology lookup service (e.g. how many followers on social media accounts, how many clients advertised on the Website).

## 3. Key Selection Criteria

The above questions have highlighted 20 factors which should be taken into account when choosing a service. These factors can be categorised into 3 groups; **ontology information, functionality** and **interfaces**, and include;

### **Ontology Information**



1. **URL**: the main URL where the ontology lookup service can be accessed
2. **Latest version of service / data / code (where applicable**): the most recent version of both the content (i.e. ontologies) and the code of the ontology lookup service
3. **Host Organisation**: the organization responsible for the maintenance of the ontology lookup service
4. **Public / private**: is the ontology lookup service a public or private infrastructure?
5. **Licence**: the licence that regulates the use and cost of the ontology lookup service
6. **Domain**: which is the knowledge domain covered by the ontologies referenced in the ontology lookup service?
7. **Quantification of community of users**: objective measures to quantify the community of users supporting and consuming an ontology lookup service, including: number of stars and forks on GitHub, number of social media followers

### **Functionality**



8. **Number and complexity of ontologies covered**: how many ontologies does the ontology lookup service cover and how complex are they?
9. **Ontology formats supported**: which ontology formats are supported by the ontology lookup service?
10. **Ontology importing capabilities**: if and how ontologies can be imported and thus indexed by the ontology lookup service?
11. **Ontology browsing capabilities**: which interaction patterns are available to browse the set of ontologies contemplated by the ontology lookup service?
12. **Ontology search capabilities**: which search patterns are provided by the ontology lookup service to identify the best concept useful to represent the semantic of a term? When searching against a term, does the ontology give an indication of whether the term has been derived from a different ontology?
13. **Ontology recommendation capabilities**: does the ontology lookup service provide users with a recommendation concerning the most suitable ontologies to semantically characterize the contents of some text / a set of keywords? 
14. **Ontology update capabilities**: how are terms and/or relationships updated in a given ontology and how is this governed? Is this an automatic or manual update and what happens to terms that are considered obsolete?
15. **Ontology versioning capabilities**: are there predefined patterns to identify, manage and compare distinct versions of an ontology? 

### **Interfaces**



16. **Description of Web-based access to service**: which ontology browsing  and search patterns are available to the (Web-based) user interface of the ontology lookup service? Does the ontology lookup service also provide programmatic access to its data and services (e.g. by means of a REST API)?
17. **Description of API**: reference to the documentation of the (REST) API provided by the ontology lookup service, if any
18. **Developer resources**: description of resources provided to developers in order to ease the programmatic access to the features of the ontology lookup service (i.e. libraries to query the REST API from a specific programming language).
19. **Local deploy of service**: possibility to locally deploy the ontology lookup service
20. **Source code reference**: if available, link to the source code of the ontology lookup service
4. **Overview of Widespread Ontology Lookup Services**
