## Main Objectives

The main purpose of this recipe is:

>  To detail the key elements for the creation of a `data catalogue` to enable data `findability` in an organisation.

We will cover the following points:

1. metadata model selection
2. annotation with controled vocabularies
3. ETL
4. data loading
5. data indexing
6. facet oriented searching
7. minting of stable, persistent and resolvable identifiers

## User Story
For **`role.Data Scientists`**, it is essential to be able to *`action.identify`* and *`action.discover`* datasets of potential relevance in the context of *`action.data integration`* and *`action.meta-analytical work`*.

For **`role.Database Managers`**, a lightweight solution is needed to support a shallow indexing supported fast ingest without intense curation, but good potential for data discovery. Works should rely on approved data standards.

For **`role.lab scientists`**, the key is to have a minimal burden when having to *`action.deposit`* a dataset to an institutional archive or simply *`action.register`* to dataset to the `data catalogue`.

## Main body of the recipe

### What is a Data Catalogue?

A `Data Catalogue` is a resource meant to allow fast identification of `Data set`. In keeping with the familiar notion of catalogue, (be it that of an exhibition or that of brand products), the notion of `data catalogue` needs to be understood as the compendium of `short descriptive metadata elements` about an actual set of data. The `Data Index or Data Catalogue` **does not** store the datasets themselves but provides information about where the datasets can be obtained from. Therefore, `Data Catalogues` are often used to index the content of '`Data Repositories` and ` Data Archives`, which provide hosting solutions for the actual datasets, which are often organized (but not always)' around specific `data types` or `data production modalities` (e.g. NMR Imaging, Confocal microscopy imaging, Nucleic Acid sequence archives and so on.)
 

### What are the standards supporting establishing a data catalogue?

`Data Catalogues` have been identified as critical infrastructure and therefore a number of model exist to support their implementation.
1. DATS:
The [Data Article Tag Suite model]() has been developed during the NIH-BD2K projects and underpins the [datamed catalogue](https://datamed.org/), the aim of which was to produce a prototype of a [`Pubmed for Datasets`](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29346583/).

3. DCAT:
In the world of semantic web technologies, The [W3C DCAT specifications]() (v1 and the newly released version 2) provide a vocabulary to express `data catalogue metadata` in **RDF**.
3. Schema.org:
The vocabulary developed by the consortium of search engines has defined a metadata profile for [`Dataset`](https://schema.org/DataSet), [`Data Catalogue`](https://schema.org/DataCatalog)


### How are Data Catalogue populated?

A number data Indexes/Data Catalogue are populated by harvest Dataset metadata from primary Data Repositories or harvesting JSON-LD files served by these same pages for rapid, shallow indexing. The former method is often richer but requires more

## Conclusion

This recipe introduced the general concept of data catalogue and why they constitute a key capability to deliver data discoverability.
