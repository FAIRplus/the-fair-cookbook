## Main Objectives

The main purpose of this recipe is:

>  To detail the key elements for the creation of a **data catalogue** to enable data **findability** in an organisation.

We will cover the following points:

1. metadata model selection
2. annotation with controlled vocabularies
3. ETL
4. data loading
5. data indexing
6. facet oriented searching
7. minting of stable, persistent and resolvable identifiers

## User Story
For **role.Data Scientists**, it is essential to be able to *action.identify* and *action.discover* datasets of potential
relevance in the context of *action.data integration* and *action.meta-analytical work*.

For **role.Database Managers**, a lightweight solution is needed to support a shallow indexing supported fast ingest 
without intense curation, but good potential for data discovery. Works should rely on approved data standards.

For **role.lab scientists**, the key is to have a minimal burden when having to *action.deposit* a dataset to an 
institutional archive or simply *action.register* to dataset to the **data catalogue**.

## Main body of the recipe

### What is a Data Catalogue?

A **Data Catalogue** is a resource meant to allow fast identification of **Data set**. In keeping with the familiar notion 
of catalogue, (be it that of an exhibition or that of brand products), the notion of **data catalogue** needs to be
understood as the compendium of **short descriptive metadata elements** about an actual set of data. The 
**Data Index or Data Catalogue** ***does not*** store the datasets themselves but provides information
about where the datasets can be obtained from. Therefore, **Data Catalogues** are often used to index the content of
'**Data Repositories** and ** Data Archives**, which provide hosting solutions for the actual datasets, which are often
organized (but not always)' around specific **data types** or **data production modalities** 
(e.g. NMR Imaging, Confocal microscopy imaging, Nucleic Acid sequence archives and so on.)
 

### What are the standards supporting establishing a data catalogue?

**Data Catalogues** have been identified as critical infrastructure and therefore a number of model exist to support their implementation.
1. DATS:
The Data Article Tag Suite model<!-- TODO add a link to corresponding document --> has been developed during the 
NIH-BD2K projects and underpins the [datamed catalogue](https://datamed.org/), the aim of which was to produce a 
prototype of a [**Pubmed for Datasets**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29346583/).

2. DCAT:
In the world of semantic web technologies, The W3C DCAT specifications<!-- TODO add a link to corresponding document -->
(v1 and the newly released version 2) provide a vocabulary to express **data catalogue metadata** in **RDF**.
3. Schema.org:
The vocabulary developed by the consortium of search engines has defined a metadata profile for [**Dataset**](https://schema.org/Dataset),
[**Data Catalogue**](https://schema.org/DataCatalog)


### How are Data Catalogue populated?

A number data Indexes/Data Catalogue are populated by harvest Dataset metadata from primary Data Repositories or harvesting JSON-LD files served by these same pages for rapid, shallow indexing. The former method is often richer but requires more 

### What are examples of Data Catalogues?

* Open source solutions:

    * [NIH DataMed](https://datamed.org/)

    * [Bayer AG Colid](https://bayer-group.github.io/COLID-Documentation/)

## Conclusion

This recipe introduced the general concept of data catalogue and why they constitute a key capability to deliver data discoverability.
