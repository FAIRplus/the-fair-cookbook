# Assessment

This chapter is dedicated to the services, tools, and indicators necessary for the assessment or the evaluation of data against the FAIR Principles, which are aspirational. 

This is a nascent area and there are a number of manual questionnaires, checklists as well as automated tests, many listed [here](https://fairassist.org), which help users understand how to achieve a state of FAIRness, and how this can be measured and improved. 

Browse existing recipes, and bear in mind that this is a ‘live resource’, and recipes are added and improved, iteratively, in an open manner.

If you want to contribute follow the {ref}`help <fcb-help>` provided, or contact us at [faircookbook-ed@elixir-europe.org](mailto:faircookbook-ed@elixir-europe.org).
