The first step in (re)using data is to find them, the second is to know how and under which condition they can be accessed.

Data are Accessible in that they can be always obtained by machines and humans:
- Upon appropriate authorization.
- Through a well-defined protocol.
- Thus, machines and humans alike will be able to judge the actual accessibilty of each data object.

This chapter is dedicated to the `practices`, `processes`, `services` and other `resources` necessary to improve the description of the conditions of access and use of data.

Browse existing recipes, and bear in mind that this is a ‘live resource’, and recipes are added and improved, iteratively, in an open manner.
