# FAIRplus Datasets Maturity Model

- A **Product** maturity model
- Measured by **Level of FAIRness** achieved for a given dataset to fulfill a given usage
<br>i.e. we will NOT use 'FAIR maturity levels' but instead use 'Level of FAIRness'
- Formed of Data Usability Scenarios
<br>Each usability scenario describes the Metadata required to fulfill the usability scenario & the capabilities expected for the data environment to exhibit

## FAIRness Level of Data Sets: Value-based FAIR Data Assessment

This section provides methods and guidance for measuring FAIRness levels of data sets with an ultimate goal of creating a value.

### What is the level of FAIRness ?

-   Level of data FAIRness measures the conformance of data objects to the FAIR principles.

-   The conformance is measured by a set of indicators which aims to formulate measurable aspects of each principle. And can be used by evaluation approaches.

-   Evaluation method is a systematic approach for assigning FAIRness levels by utilizing the measurements collected by indicators


### FAIRplus Dataset Maturity Model Framework


- FAIRplus project introduces a Dataset Maturity Model for the life sciences domain. This framework extends RDA Data Maturity Model for addressing specific needs of the research area.

- The FAIRplus DMM framework builds on top of the RDA model, while it extends the list of indicators for measuring a set of data usage scenarios in life sciences.


- FAIRplus DMM framework has following components:

	-   [Data Usage Areas](Data-Usage-Areas.md)

	-   Indicators:
		 - [RDA Indicators](RDA-Indicators.md)
		 - [FAIR+ Indicators](FAIRPlus-Indicators.md)

	-   [Evaluation Method](evaluation-method.md)
