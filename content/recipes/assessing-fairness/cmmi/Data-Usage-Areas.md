# Data Usage Areas

## Data Usage Areas

Each organization or research community might have different business goals for re-using data. These different re-use areas require different attention for improving findability, accessibility and interoperability of data sets. Following table provides an overview of these data re-use areas, and for each area what action can be taken to improve data management processes and potential benefits.



|Data Usage Area                |Aim |Expected Benefit|
|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|<a name="Interpretability"> Data Interpretability </a>|Improve reuse of data by another person.<br>-   Provide metadata about how data is organized and structured.<br>-   Document the content of data files, and their relations.<br>  -   Identify and validate data types and formats           |- Reduces time spent for each person examining and understanding existing research data.            |
|<a name="Integration"> Data Integration </a>|Improve data consolidation & harmonization.<br>-   Annotate data with common vocabularies, ontologies.  <br>-   Use of common master data and reference data (if available). <br>-   Use common data profiles, models, schemas for semantic modelling(if available).<br>-   Improve interoperability by mapping terminologies (e.g. via identifier linksets).           |- Reduces time for data cleaning and integration.<br>- Increases the likelihood of linking datasets with other sets automatically.            |
|<a name="Repurposing"> Data Repurposing </a> |Improve reuse of data in another context, such as with different research hypotheses.<br>-   Document research hypothesis and data inclusion and exclusion criteria  <br>-   Document reference materials, such as cell lines and microorganisms. <br>-   Document different steps of research lifecycle and their data outputs.<br>-   Provide raw data or primary data, not only derived and analyzed data sets.<br>-   Provide a variety of research outcomes, such as negative results.|- Reduces the resources spent for generating data for research hypotheses.<br>- Improves repurposing of data as part of a new study.|
|<a name="Reproducibility"> Data Reproducibility </a>|Improve repeatability, replicability, reproducibility of research outcomes<br>-   Provide documentation and guidelines for describing research protocols.<br>-   Provide provenance of experiment such as measuring tools, locations, conditions, hypothesis, time periods, study design (power analysis, sample sizes)<br>-   Identify the key resources such as antibodies, model organisms and software.<br>-   Share materials, software, and other tools used for data analysis|- Ensures transparency, gives confidence in understanding study.<br>- Increases the likelihood of attaining results by a different or same research team, using the same or different experiment setups.|



Potential future Data Usage areas:

-   Regulatory Reporting: Easily fulfill the mandatory reporting requirements

-   Data Analytics (machine actionable data): Easy access by services and running algorithms and computational models


## Maturity of each data usage area is measured via a set of indicators
