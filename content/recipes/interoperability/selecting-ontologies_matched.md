## Main Objectives

The main purpose of this recipe is to provide guidance on how to select the most suitable semantic artefacts given a specific research (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_6314 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.52b22c)  context in general, and when it comes to life and biomedical sciences project (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_6313 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=project) s, their main themes, i.e. *risk assessment*, *clinical trial*, *drug discovery* or *fundamental research (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_6315 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.52b22c) *.

## Context is everything

The domain of operation will generally dictate the semantic framework that is most suited to a given dataset. This is simply due to the fact that the advances in data standard (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_6325 https://fairsharing.org/search?fairsharingRegistry=Standard) ization in specific fields are such that it is a sound decision to adopt a complete stack of standard (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_6326 https://fairsharing.org/search?fairsharingRegistry=Standard) s, both syntactic and semantic.

Here, we present the three most common scenarios in biomedical research (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_6327 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.52b22c) , based on experience garnered during IMI eTRIKS (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_6328 https://fairsharing.org/3510)  {footcite}`philippe_rocca_serra_2016_50825`:
- [Clinical Trial Data](#clinical-trial-data)
- [Observational Health Data](#observational-health-data)
- [Basic research context](#basic-research (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_6329 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.52b22c) -context)

### Clinical Trial Data

Operating in the field of Clinical Trials means that datasets are generated during `interventional studies`, meaning that research (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_6330 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.52b22c) ers influence and control the predictor variables, which are usually different intensity levels of therapeutic agents, in order to gain insights in terms of benefits in patient outcomes.
In this context, regulator (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_6333 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.ey49c6) y requirements make it so that data must be recorded in standard (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_6331 https://fairsharing.org/search?fairsharingRegistry=Standard)  forms to allow for review and appraisal by regulator (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_6334 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.ey49c6) s such as FDA reviewers in the US. The [CDISC standards](https://www.cdisc.org (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_6335 https://fairsharing.org/3525) /standards) are the *`de-facto standard (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_6332 https://fairsharing.org/search?fairsharingRegistry=Standard) `* in this area, which mandates the use of semantics resources such as:

```{warning}
Some resources are only available under restrictive licences, which prevent derivative work, which may limit access and use. Furthermore, some licenses are expensive.  
```

### Observational Health Data

This context refers to data collected during `observational studies`, which in contrast to `interventional studies`, draw inferences from a sample to a population where the independent variable is not under the control of the research (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_6349 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.52b22c) er because of ethical concerns or logistical constraints [1]. This is typically the case in epidemiological work or exposure follow-up studies in the context of risk assessment and evaluation of clinical outcomes. `Observational health data` can also include `electronic health records (EHR)` or ` administrative insurance claims` and allow research (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_6350 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.52b22c)  around acquiring *`real world evidence`* from large corpora of data.
In this specific context, one model (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_6353 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=model_and_format)  and associated set of standard (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_6351 https://fairsharing.org/search?fairsharingRegistry=Standard) s has been particularly successful. With several hundred millions of patients' informat (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_6355 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=model_and_format) ion structured using the **Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership ([OMOP](https://ohdsi.org/omop/))**, the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informat (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_6356 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=model_and_format) ics ([ODHSI](https://ohdsi.org/)) `open-science community` has laid the foundation for a widely adopted data model (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_6354 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=model_and_format) . Therefore, building a FAIR (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_6357 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.WWI10U) ification process around the standard (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_6352 https://fairsharing.org/search?fairsharingRegistry=Standard)  stack produced by the ODHSI community needs to be considered if operating in such a `data context`.

For a more detailed overview and deep-dive into the ODHSI and OMOP semantic support, we recommend the reading of the chapter dedicated to the `controlled terminology (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_6367 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=terminology_artefact) ` [in the **`Book of OHDSI`**](https://ohdsi.github.io/TheBookOfOhdsi/StandardizedVocabularies.html) {footcite}`pmid27274072`


### Basic research context

This refers to datasets and research (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_6370 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.52b22c)  output being generated using model (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_6368 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=model_and_format)  organisms and cellular systems in the context of basic, fundamental research (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_6371 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.52b22c) . In this arena, the regulator (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_6369 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.ey49c6) y pressure is much less present but this does not rule out data management best practices and proper arch (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_6372 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.52b22c) ival requirements.
As a consequence of fewer constraints, research (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_6373 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.52b22c) ers are often confronted with a sea of options. This and the next sections aim to provide some guidance when tasked with deciding on which semantic resource to use.

```{admonition} Tip
:class: tip
 **An important consideration** 
to bear in mind when selecting semantic resources is to assess whether or not `data archival in public repositories will be required`. For instance, submitting to NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus Data archive places no particular constraints on data annotations but if depositing to EMBL-EBI ArrayExpress, then selecting a resource such as the Experimental Factor Ontology ([EFO](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/)) for annotating data could ease deposition.
```

```{admonition} Tip
:class: tip
 **[The FAIRsharing registry](https://fairsharing.org)** {footcite}`pmid30940948` is an ELIXIR resource which provides invaluable content as the catalogue offers an overview of the various semantics artefact used by public data repositories.
```

## Selecting Terminologies 


### Use Cases and General Recommendations

1. The use and implementation of common terminologies (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_6375 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=terminology_artefact)  enables the normalisation and harmonisation of both variable labels and allowed values for each field. Implementing the use of common terminologies (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_6376 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=terminology_artefact)  in the data collection (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_6374 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=collection)  or curation workflow will ensure consistency of the annotation across all data. This is particularly important if data is generated at multiple partner sites and/or by multiple individuals. 

2. If data fields are annotated with terms from freely chosen ontologies (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_6382 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=terminology_artefact)  (rather than those dictated by a common model (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_6377 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=model_and_format)  such as CDSIC), care should be taken to avoid picking terms from ontologies (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_6383 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=terminology_artefact)  at random. If a set of concepts are all available in one ontology (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_6378 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=terminology_artefact) , this ontology (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_6379 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=terminology_artefact)  should be preferred over a set of ontologies (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_6384 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=terminology_artefact) . Map (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_6385 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.53edcc) ping services such as [OxO](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/spot/oxo (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_6386 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.0c6fea) /) are available to verify whether a term of interest in one ontology (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_6380 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=terminology_artefact)  has an equivalent term in another ontology (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_6381 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=terminology_artefact) .

3. Restrictions of allowed values for a given field should ideally be limited to a single ontology (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_6387 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=terminology_artefact)  and better yet, to a single branch of a chosen ontology (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_6388 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=terminology_artefact) . This will vastly improve the semantic queryability as well as the consistency and interoperability of the data. 

4. Many ontologies (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_6391 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=terminology_artefact)  and vocabularies reuse concepts from other ontologies (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_6392 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=terminology_artefact) , in line with best practice in ontology (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_6389 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=terminology_artefact)  design, to limit duplication of efforts and proliferation of parallel synonymous concepts. Care should however be taken to use concepts in the most appropriate environment. This is usually their original source unless they are used as part of a larger set of terms. As an example, the Experimental Factor Ontology (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_6390 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=terminology_artefact)  (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_6399 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.1gr4tz)  (EFO) reuses concepts from a range of ontologies (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_6393 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=terminology_artefact) , including species from the NCBI taxonomy (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_6394 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.fj07xj) , assays from OBI (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_6396 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.284e1z) , and diseases and phenotypes from MONDO (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_6397 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.b2979t)  and HP (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_6398 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.kbtt7f) O. If annotating a dataset or resource which covers all of these concepts, it therefore makes sense to use EFO (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_6400 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.1gr4tz)  as the primary annotation source. However, if only annotations for species are required, the NCBI taxonomy (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_6395 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.fj07xj)  should be used directly to ensure completeness, since not all species in NCBItaxon will have been imported into EFO (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_6401 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.1gr4tz) .



### Selection Criteria

A set of widely accepted criteria for selecting terminologies (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_6404 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=terminology_artefact)  (or other reporting standard (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_6402 https://fairsharing.org/search?fairsharingRegistry=Standard) s) does not exist. There are however a number of excellent publications such as ["A sea of standards for omics data: sink or swim?"](https://doi.org/10.1136/amiajnl-2013-002066) {footcite}`pmid24076747` and ["Ten Simple Rules for Selection a Bio-ontology"](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004743) {footcite}`pmid26867217` providing some guidance on the subject. Below are a set of suggested criteria for evaluating the suitability of a terminology (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_6403 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=terminology_artefact)  resource.


*   **Exclusion criteria**:
    * ๐ธ Absent licence or terms of use (_indicator of usability_)
    * ๐ธ Restrictive licences or terms of use with restrictions on redistribution and reuse 
    * ๐ธ Absence of term definitions 
    * ๐ธ Absence of sufficient class metadata (_indicator of quality_)
    * ๐ธ Absence of sustainability indicators (_absence of funding records_) 
 
*   **Inclusion criteria**:
    * ๐ฐ  Scope and coverage meets the requirements of the concept identified
    * ๐ฐ  Unique URI (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_6405 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.d261e1) , textual definition and IDs for each term

    * ๐ฐ  Number of classes and subclasses (_indicator of depth_)
    * ๐ฐ  Number of terms having definitions and synonyms (_indicator of richness_)
    * ๐ฐ  Presence of a help desk and contact point (_indicator of community support_)
    * ๐ฐ  Presence of term submission tracker/issue tracker (_indicator of resource agility and capability to grow upon request_)
    * ๐ฐ  Potential integrative nature of the resource (_as indicator of translational application potential_)
    * ๐ฐ  Licensing informat (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_6406 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=model_and_format) ion available (_as indicator of freedom to use_)
    * ๐ฐ  Use of a top level ontology (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_6407 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=terminology_artefact)  (_as indicator of a resource built for generic use_)
    * ๐ฐ  Pragmatism (_as indicator of actual, current real life practice)_
    * ๐ฐ  Possibility of collaborating: the resource accepts complaints/remarks that aim to fix or improve the terminology (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_6408 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=terminology_artefact) , while the resource organisation commits to fix or improve the terminology (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_6409 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=terminology_artefact)  in brief delays (one month after receipt?)


### Set of Core Terminologies 

The terminologies (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_6410 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=terminology_artefact)  presented here have been organized by theme and scope. When possible, sections are organized by `granularity levels`, progressing from `macroscopic scale` (organism) to `microscopic scale` (tissue, cells) and `molecular scale` (macromolecules, proteins, small molecules, xenobiotic chemicals).
Domains also cover `processes` or `actions` and their `participants` or `agents` but also can be organized from `general/generic` (disease) to `specialized/specific` (infectious disease).


#### Organism, Organism Parts and Developmental Stages

The resources listed here focus on providing structured vocabularies to describe `taxonomic` and `anatomical` informat (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_6411 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=model_and_format) ion.

In research (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_6423 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.52b22c) , many different model (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_6421 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=model_and_format)  organisms are used (e.g. Dogs, Monkeys...) and specialized resources are available for many model (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_6422 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=model_and_format)  organisms, including C. elegans, Drosophila, Xenopus, Zebrafish, plants and fungi. Use the selection criteria introduced earlier to gauge their value in the data management workflow and their impact on data integration tasks.




#### Diseases and Phenotype

Biology is a complex field and observable manifestations of biological processes in living organisms vary, dependant on genetic background and environmental factors. Working on correlating genetic features with observable (phenotypic) ones, biologists rely heavily on such variables in the quest of disease biomarkers, which could be used to identify possible therapeutic targets. The main challenge is to ensure efficient machine actionable descriptions of these observable features.

#### Assays and Technologies

The resources listed in this section are providing key descriptors bridging data acquisition procedures (as used in a clinical setting and wet lab work) with instruments, units of measurements, endpoints as well as sometimes the biological process or molecular entities of biological significance.
Some of the resources are specialized semantic artefacts developed (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_6532 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.31385c)  to support the standard (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_6531 https://fairsharing.org/search?fairsharingRegistry=Standard) ized reporting of data modalities.

Some multi-domain ontologies (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_6568 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=terminology_artefact)  such as the NCI Thesaurus (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_6569 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.4cvwxa)  (NCIt (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_6570 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.4cvwxa) ) and the Experimental Factor Ontology (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_6566 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=terminology_artefact)  (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_6571 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.1gr4tz)  (EFO) also cover aspects of the above domains such as assays and sample collection (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_6565 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=collection)  and processing. Depending on the overall context of a resource selection process, it can make more sense to use a multi-domain ontology (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_6567 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=terminology_artefact)  with suitable coverage to improve consistency and interoperability within a resource or dataset.


Finally, a resource exists that describes statistical measures, statistical tests or methods as well as statistically relevant graphical representations. It may be used for reporting results and annotating experimental results (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_6572 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.QlUiql) .

### Relations

Also known as `OWL Properties`, their importance may be overlooked by `data scientists` who are not `knowledge engineers` or `ontologists`. These are essential components as, when correctly crafted with a proper understanding of the logical constraints available to semantic languages such as OWL (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_6580 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.atygwy) , are exploited by tools known as `reasoners` to carry the following key tasks:

* `Ontology (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_6581 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=terminology_artefact)  logical consistency` checks
* `Automatic classification` and `inference` tasks
* `Entailments`, i.e. detection of logical consequences resulting from axiomatic definitions (closely related to the point above)

This is particularly important when processing billions of facts expressed as RDF (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_6582 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.p77ph9)  statements. 

One also needs to understand the current limitations in expressivity afforded by the current semantic web languages and the associated axiomatics as well as computational constraints associated with inference. For more *in-depth* review of such topics, the reader is invited to consults the following work {footcite}`pmid15892874` <!--[by Smith et al](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gb-2005-6-5-r46)-->.

In the field of Biology and Biomedicine, the [OBO Foundry](http://obofoundry.org) coordinates the development of interoperable ontologies (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_6583 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=terminology_artefact) . At the core (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_6585 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.m283c)  (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_6586 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.xMmOCL)  of this interoperation lies the **[Relation Ontology](http://www.obofoundry.org (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_6584 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.847069) /ontology/ro.html)** released under the [CC0 1.0 Universal](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) license.

As `knowledge graphs` and `property graphs` gain importance, we can expect the range and depth of relations to mature and expand as more expressivity is needed and progress is made by reasoner technology to fully exploit their benefits.
This would also have to be placed in the context of advances in `Text Mining` and `Machine Learning`, where unsupervised methods start to demonstrate strong potential to detect relations between entities.

The following is an example of how a `defined class` may be created in an ontology (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_6606 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=terminology_artefact) . The code snippet shows one such class being expressed to create a type by specifying a number of `axioms`. These use `relations` (aka OWL (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_6607 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.atygwy)  Properties), which may be set to 

```bash
'B cell, CD19-positive'
equivalentClass :
    'lymphocyte of B lineage, CD19-positive' 
    and ( 'has plasma membrane part' some 'CD19 molecule') 
    and ( 'in taxon' some Mammalia) 
    and ( 'capable of' some 'B cell mediated immunity')
```

Any class satisfying these patterns may be classified by an OWL (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_6608 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.atygwy)  reasoner as a child of that class. So the following class, with such properties that they all satisfy the requirements of the `defined class` declared above (e.g. "Homo sapiens" is_a type of "Mammalia", etc...), will be classified automatically (i.e. without human intervention) by a reasoner such as ELK or Hermit as a child of 'B cell, CD19-positive' .

```bash
'human B cell, CD19-positive'
Class:
    ( 'has plasma membrane part' some 'B-lymphocyte antigen CD19 isoform h2')
    and ( 'in taxon' some 'Homo sapiens') 
    and ( 'capable of' some 'B cell tolerance induction in mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue')

```

The notion is important to grasp as it also explains why not all ontologies (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_6609 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=terminology_artefact)  are compatible, because they may significantly differ in the underlying axioms they rely on to establish their hierarch (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_6610 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.52b22c) ies using reasoners.



## Conclusions

> Selecting semantic resources depends on many different factors. However, the most important factor remains the `context` of the data and associated landscape of data standard (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_6611 https://fairsharing.org/search?fairsharingRegistry=Standard) s as well as the ultimate integration goal, which will dictate the final choice.
> 
>The selection process remains guided by the need to maximize the potential of data integration with datasets of similar nature and similar value. It also requires a good understanding of the technical and sometimes legal implications these choices will have.
