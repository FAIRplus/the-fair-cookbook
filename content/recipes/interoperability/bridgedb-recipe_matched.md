## Identifier mapping with BridgeDb

{ref}`Interlinking data from different sources <fcb-identifier-mapping>` is an essential step for data reusability and interoperability. This step requires dedicated tools. With the present recipe, we show how to use [BridgeDb](https://bridgedb.github.io/) to carry out this process.

[BridgeDb](https://bridgedb.github.io/) is an open source tool dedicated to performing identifier mapping {footcite}`van_iersel_bridgedb_2010`. BridgeDb (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD-NAME_1570 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.5ry74y)  offers three different interfaces:
* Java API
* R package
* REST Web-services


> üìñ In the context of this recipe, we distinguish between two types of identifiers:
>* *Local identifiers* which refer to identifiers that are minted within an organization or database and thus internally defined (i.e. local to said organization). 
>* *Global identifiers* which refer to identifiers that are globally unique and uniquely point to an entity, as available from BridgeDb (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD-NAME_1571 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.5ry74y) 's [data sources file](https://github.com/bridgedb/datasources)

We will focus here on two distinct cases, depending on the nature of the incoming data. Namely, whether our data is already using global identifiers or only relies on local identifiers. 

In this recipe, we will cover how BridgeDb (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD-NAME_1572 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.5ry74y) 's R package and webservices can be used to map (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD-NAME_1573 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.53edcc)  between resource identifiers.

### Mapping a global identifier to other global identifiers
In this case, the input data is a list of elements with an identifier that is part of [BridgeDb's data sources](https://github.com/bridgedb/datasources). In our example, we will use a list of Homo Sapien Hugo Gene Nomenclature Convention ([HGNC](http://www.genenames.org)) gene identifiers stored in a TSV (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD-ABBREV_1574 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.a978c9)  file. The objective is to map (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD-NAME_1575 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.53edcc)  these to other available gene identifiers.

#### BridgeDb via Webservices using Python
> ‚ùó For this tutorial Python v3.8.5, [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) v1.1.3, and BridgeDb (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD-NAME_1576 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.5ry74y)  Webservices v0.9.0 were used.

One of the biggest benefits of using BridgeDb (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD-NAME_1577 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.5ry74y)  webservices is that these can be accessed using most programming languages. Python has become one of the leading programming languages in data science and predictive modelling. Despite the lack of a dedicated BridgeDb (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD-NAME_1578 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.5ry74y)  Python library, we show here how to use the BridgeDb (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD-NAME_1579 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.5ry74y)  Webservices to perform exemplary mappings.

We start by defining strings containing the URL (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD-ABBREV_1581 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.9d38e2)  of the webservices and the specific method from the Webservices we want to use. In our case, a `batch cross reference`. When doing the query, we need to specify **the organism** and **the source dataset**. We can also *optionally* specify a *target data source* if we only want to map (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD-NAME_1582 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.53edcc)  to a specific data source, e.g. Ensembl (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD-NAME_1580 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.fx0mw7) .

```python
url = "https://webservice.bridgedb.org/"
batch_request = url+"{org}/xrefsBatch/{source}{}"
```

If the aim is to map (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD-NAME_1583 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.53edcc)  only to a specific target data source, then one can check whether the mapping is supported by invoking the following webservice call:  

```python
mapping_available = "{org}/isMappingSupported/{source}/{target}"
query = url+mapping_available.format(org='Homo sapiens', source='H', target='En')
requests.get(query).text
```

This will return `True` if the mapping between the given source and target is supported for the given organism or `False` otherwise.

We then load our data into a pandas dataframe and call the requests library using our query.

```python
query = batch_request.format('?dataSource=En', org='Homo sapiens', source='H')
response = requests.post(query, data=data.to_csv(index=False, header=False))
```

The webservice response is now stored in the `response` variable. We can then simply pass this variable to the `to_df` method provided in the `bridgedb_script.py` module (see [Code](#Code)). This method will extract the response in text form and turn it into a pandas Dataframe with conveniently named columns and structured data.

The output table will contain the:
* Original identifier
* Data source that the identifier is part of
* Mapped identifier
* Data source for the mapped identifier

In our case the output of `to_df` is:

| original   | source   | mapping         | target   |
|:-----------|:---------|:----------------|:---------|
| A1BG       | HGNC (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD-ABBREV_1584 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.amcv1e)  (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD-ABBREV_1585 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.29we0s)      | ENSG00000121410 | En       |
| A1CF       | HGNC (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD-ABBREV_1586 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.amcv1e)  (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD-ABBREV_1587 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.29we0s)      | ENSG00000148584 | En       |
| A2MP1      | HGNC (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD-ABBREV_1588 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.amcv1e)  (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD-ABBREV_1589 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.29we0s)      | ENSG00000256069 | En       |

If we were to not specify the target data source (by passing an empty string (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD-NAME_1590 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.9b7wvk)  as the parameter), we would get all the potential mappings for the given identifiers. In our case (top 10 rows):

| original   | source   | mapping      | target   |

| A1BG       | HGNC (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD-ABBREV_1591 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.amcv1e)  (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD-ABBREV_1592 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.29we0s)      | uc002qsd.5   | Uc       |

| A1BG       | HGNC (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD-ABBREV_1610 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.amcv1e)  (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD-ABBREV_1611 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.29we0s)      | uc061drt.1   | Uc       |

As one can see, using the BridgeDb (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD-NAME_1614 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.5ry74y)  webservice via Python is extremely simple and can be easily integrated in an annotation pipeline.


#### BridgeDb via the dedicated R package

```{note} 
For this tutorial R v4.0.3, [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) v1.3.0, and [BridgeDbR](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/BridgeDbR.html) v2.0.0 were used.
```

After having loaded the required R libraries, we read the data and create a new column to include the source of the identifier.

```r
data_df <- read_tsv(filepath, col_names=c('identifier'))
data_df$source = 'H'
``` 

We then load the data for the organism we are mapping from.

```r
 location <- getDatabase('Homo sapiens')
 mapper <- loadDatabase(location)
```

And use the library's     dedicated function to map (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD-NAME_1615 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.53edcc)  the identifiers:

```r
mapping = maps(mapper, data_df, target='En')
```
This will return:
| identifier | source | target | mapping         |
|:---------- |:------ |:------ |:--------------- |
| A1BG       | H      | En     | ENSG00000121410 |
| A1CF       | H      | En     | ENSG00000148584 |
| A2MP1      | H      | En     | ENSG00000256069 |

As seen earlier when using Python language, we can obtain all possible mappings simply by not specifying the target. This will result in (top 10) 
| identifier | source | target | mapping      |
|:---------- |:------ |:------ |:------------ |
| A1BG       | H      | Uc     | uc002qsd.5   |
| A1BG       | H      | X      | 8039748      |
| A1BG       | H      | T      | GO (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD-ABBREV_1616 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.6xq0ee) :0072562   |
| A1BG       | H      | Uc     | uc061drj.1   |
| A1BG       | H      | Il     | ILMN_2055271 |
| A1BG       | H      | U      | Hs.529161    |
| A1BG       | H      | T      | GO (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD-ABBREV_1617 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.6xq0ee) :0070062   |
| A1BG       | H      | T      | GO (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD-ABBREV_1618 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.6xq0ee) :0002576   |
| A1BG       | H      | Uc     | uc061drt.1   |
| A1BG       | H      | X      | 51020_at     |

```{warning} 
An error message indicating "Error in download.file" may be thrown. This may be caused by the `timeout` variable being set to too small a value. To remediate the issue, try increasing the timeout variable value by calling `options(timeout=300)`.
```

<!--
This will maybe link to the identifier mapping recipe in the future, where there will be a specific section detailing identifier equivalence files taking into account scientific lenses, as discussed with Egon. 

--------------------------------


### Mapping a local identifier to global identifier
[NEED HELP HERE]
This is a step that should be done manually. In this case an important decision should be made, which identifiers to map to. To decide this you should look for the data source that contains the closest definition of the concepts to the one you used for your local identifiers.

-->

### Mapping local identifier to a different global identifier

```{note} 
 In this section, we assume that we already have an equivalence file containing the mapping of a local identifier to one of the global identifiers. In our case, this will be contained in a TSV where we map our local gene identifier to [HGNC](http://www.genenames.org). One may consult the list of other potential data formats in the {ref}`fcb-identifier-mapping` recipe. The mapping should be **one-to-one** for this recipe. 
```

The TSV (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD-ABBREV_1619 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.a978c9)  mapping file looks as follows:
| local   | source   |
|:--------|:---------|
| aa11    | A1BG     |
| bb34    | A1CF     |
| eg93    | A2MP1    |

You may notice the `source` identifiers correspond with those used in the previous example.


This is how the mapping will work

#### Webservices in Python

As before, we will define variables including the `web-service's URL (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD-ABBREV_1623 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.9d38e2) ` and the `method` that we will use, in this instance: `xRefsBatch`.
We then pass the source column to the `post request` as follows

```python
source_data = case2.source.to_csv(index=False, header=False)
query = batch_request.format('', org=org, source=source)
response2 = requests.post(query, data = source_data)
```
You may notice here that we did not pass a target source, this could be done as specified before. Then, we use `to_df` again and as expected obtain the same dataframe as before.
To see the equivalences with our local identifiers, we can simply join the dataframes, as follows:

```python
local_mapping = mappings.join(case2.set_index('source'), on='original')
```
which will return the following table (first 10 rows)
| original   | source   | mapping      | target   | local   |

In case we did specify the `target` argument to be `Ensembl (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD-NAME_1647 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.fx0mw7)  (En)`, we would instead get

Here, we see a `one-to-one` relation between the identifiers in HGNC (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD-ABBREV_1655 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.amcv1e)  (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD-ABBREV_1657 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.29we0s)  and En while the relation between HGNC (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD-ABBREV_1656 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.amcv1e)  (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD-ABBREV_1658 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.29we0s)  and UCSC Genome Browser (Uc) or Gene Ontology (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD-NAME_1654 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.6xq0ee)  (T) is `one-to-many`. Depending on the identifiers and resources, the relation could also be `many-to-many` as shown below.

An example of a mapping via BridgeDb (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD-NAME_1661 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.5ry74y) . You may notice that despite the 1-to-1 relation between `local` and `original` we get a N-to-N relation between `local` and `mapping` due to the N-to-N relation between `original` and `mapping`.
```
````

```{note} 
This many-to-many relationship stems from different *scientific lenses* in the data sources. You can read more about these in {footcite}`batchelor_scientific_nodate`. The core idea is that depending on the domain/application of the data we can consider different entities as unique. While certain proteins could be considered "equal" from a biological perspective they may require differentiation when using a chemical len. This is what then leads to many-to-many relationships.
```

#### R Package

Here, we will follow the same steps as in the previous case. The only difference is that we need to specify the columns/fields to use when loading the data:

```r
data_df <- read_tsv(filepath, col_names=c('local', 'identifier'))
``` 
Then, after computing the mapping, we can join it with the local identifier

```r
right_join(data_df, mapping)
```
Assuming we did not specify the target data source we obtain the following table (first 10 rows):
| local | identifier | source | target | mapping      |
|:----- |:--------   |:------ |:------ |:------------ |
| aa11  | A1BG       | H      | Uc     | uc002qsd.5   |
| aa11  | A1BG       | H      | X      | 8039748      |
| aa11  | A1BG       | H      | T      | GO (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD-ABBREV_1662 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.6xq0ee) :0072562   |
| aa11  | A1BG       | H      | Uc     | uc061drj.1   |
| aa11  | A1BG       | H      | Il     | ILMN_2055271 |
| aa11  | A1BG       | H      | U      | Hs.529161    |
| aa11  | A1BG       | H      | T      | GO (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD-ABBREV_1663 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.6xq0ee) :0070062   |
| aa11  | A1BG       | H      | T      | GO (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD-ABBREV_1664 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.6xq0ee) :0002576   |
| aa11  | A1BG       | H      | Uc     | uc061drt.1   |
| aa11  | A1BG       | H      | X      | 51020_at     |

In case we did specify the target data source we would get:

| local | identifier | source | target | mapping         |
|:----- |:---------- |:------ |:------ |:--------------- |

## Provenance

BridgeDb (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD-NAME_1671 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.5ry74y)  provides provenance information through:
* A call to `/properties/` method of the Webservice
* `getProperties()` in BridgeDbR (passing the mapper as a parameter)

This returns the following information for each of the data sources for a given organism:
* Data source name
* Build date
* Series
* Data type
* Data source version
* Schema version

Improvements on provenance are under way (see [here](https://github.com/bridgedb/BridgeDb/issues/164)).

## Code 
You can find ready-made methods to map (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD-NAME_1672 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.53edcc)  using R and Python for the given use cases [here](https://github.com/FAIRplus/the-fair-cookbook/tree/9ad9481be32812b2565f9f9f1897642ae26eddff/content/recipes/interoperability/bridgedb/data). These assume the data has the structure described in this recipe.

## Conclusion

We showed how to use BridgeDb (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD-NAME_1673 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.5ry74y) 's webservices and R package to map (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD-NAME_1674 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.53edcc)  identifiers from different data sources using a minimal dataset. 
BridgeDb (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD-NAME_1675 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.5ry74y)  provides handy functionality to make 'omics' data more interoperable and reusable.
As with all annotation services, it is important to bear in mind the version of the service being used as well as the data on which the service invokation has been performed.
These are aspects of information provenance which we plan to provide in the future.
