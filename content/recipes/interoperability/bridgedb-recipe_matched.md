## Identifier mapping with BridgeDb

{ref}`Interlinking data from different sources <fcb-identifier (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_3068 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=identifier_schema) -mapping>` is an essential step for data reusability and interoperability. This step requires dedicated tools. With the present recipe, we show how to use [BridgeDb](https://bridgedb.github.io/) to carry out this process.

[BridgeDb](https://bridgedb.github.io/) is an open source tool dedicated to performing identifier (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_3069 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=identifier_schema)  mapping {footcite}`van_iersel_bridgedb_2010`. BridgeDb (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD-NAME_3070 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.5ry74y)  offers three different interfaces:
* Java API
* R package
* REST Web-services


> üìñ In the context of this recipe, we distinguish between two types of identifier (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_3071 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=identifier_schema) s:
>* *Local identifier (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_3073 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=identifier_schema) s* which refer to identifier (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_3074 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=identifier_schema) s that are minted within an organization or database (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_3072 https://fairsharing.org/search?fairsharingRegistry=Database)  and thus internally defined (i.e. local to said organization). 
>* *Global identifier (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_3075 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=identifier_schema) s* which refer to identifier (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_3076 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=identifier_schema) s that are globally unique and uniquely point to an entity, as available from BridgeDb (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD-NAME_3077 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.5ry74y) 's [data sources file](https://github.com/bridgedb/datasources)

We will focus here on two distinct cases, depending on the nature of the incoming data. Namely, whether our data is already using global identifier (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_3078 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=identifier_schema) s or only relies on local identifier (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_3079 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=identifier_schema) s. 

In this recipe, we will cover how BridgeDb (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD-NAME_3081 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.5ry74y) 's R package and webservices can be used to map (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD-NAME_3082 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.53edcc)  between resource identifier (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_3080 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=identifier_schema) s.

### Mapping a global identifier to other global identifiers
In this case, the input data is a list of elements with an identifier (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_3083 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=identifier_schema)  that is part of [BridgeDb's data sources](https://github.com/bridgedb/datasources). In our example, we will use a list of Homo Sapien Hugo Gene Nomenclature Convention ([HGNC](http://www.genenames.org)) gene identifier (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_3084 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=identifier_schema) s stored in a TSV (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD-ABBREV_3086 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.a978c9)  file. The objective is to map (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD-NAME_3087 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.53edcc)  these to other available gene identifier (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_3085 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=identifier_schema) s.

#### BridgeDb via Webservices using Python
> ‚ùó For this tutorial Python v3.8.5, [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) v1.1.3, and BridgeDb (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD-NAME_3088 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.5ry74y)  Webservices v0.9.0 were used.

One of the biggest benefits of using BridgeDb (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD-NAME_3090 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.5ry74y)  webservices is that these can be accessed using most programming languages. Python has become one of the leading programming languages in data science and predictive model (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_3089 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=model_and_format) ling. Despite the lack of a dedicated BridgeDb (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD-NAME_3091 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.5ry74y)  Python library, we show here how to use the BridgeDb (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD-NAME_3092 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.5ry74y)  Webservices to perform exemplary mappings.

We start by defining strings containing the URL (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD-ABBREV_3094 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.9d38e2)  of the webservices and the specific method from the Webservices we want to use. In our case, a `batch cross reference`. When doing the query, we need to specify **the organism** and **the source dataset**. We can also *optionally* specify a *target data source* if we only want to map (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD-NAME_3095 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.53edcc)  to a specific data source, e.g. Ensembl (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD-NAME_3093 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.fx0mw7) .

```python
url = "https://webservice.bridgedb.org/"
batch_request = url+"{org}/xrefsBatch/{source}{}"
```

If the aim is to map (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD-NAME_3096 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.53edcc)  only to a specific target data source, then one can check whether the mapping is supported by invoking the following webservice call:  

```python
mapping_available = "{org}/isMappingSupported/{source}/{target}"
query = url+mapping_available.format(org='Homo sapiens', source='H', target='En')
requests.get(query).text
```

This will return `True` if the mapping between the given source and target is supported for the given organism or `False` otherwise.

We then load our data into a pandas dataframe and call the requests library using our query.

```python
query = batch_request.format('?dataSource=En', org='Homo sapiens', source='H')
response = requests.post(query, data=data.to_csv(index=False, header=False))
```

The webservice response is now stored in the `response` variable. We can then simply pass this variable to the `to_df` method provided in the `bridgedb_script.py` module (see [Code](#Code)). This method will extract the response in text form and turn it into a pandas Dataframe with conveniently named columns and structured data.

The output table will contain the:
* Original identifier (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_3097 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=identifier_schema) 
* Data source that the identifier (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_3098 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=identifier_schema)  is part of
* Mapped identifier (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_3099 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=identifier_schema) 
* Data source for the mapped identifier (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_3100 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=identifier_schema) 

In our case the output of `to_df` is:

| original   | source   | mapping         | target   |
|:-----------|:---------|:----------------|:---------|
| A1BG       | HGNC (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD-ABBREV_3101 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.amcv1e)  (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD-ABBREV_3102 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.29we0s)      | ENSG00000121410 | En       |
| A1CF       | HGNC (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD-ABBREV_3103 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.amcv1e)  (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD-ABBREV_3104 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.29we0s)      | ENSG00000148584 | En       |
| A2MP1      | HGNC (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD-ABBREV_3105 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.amcv1e)  (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD-ABBREV_3106 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.29we0s)      | ENSG00000256069 | En       |

If we were to not specify the target data source (by passing an empty string (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD-NAME_3108 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.9b7wvk)  as the parameter), we would get all the potential mappings for the given identifier (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_3107 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=identifier_schema) s. In our case (top 10 rows):

| original   | source   | mapping      | target   |

As one can see, using the BridgeDb (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD-NAME_3132 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.5ry74y)  webservice via Python is extremely simple and can be easily integrated in an annotation pipeline.


#### BridgeDb via the dedicated R package

```{note} 
For this tutorial R v4.0.3, [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) v1.3.0, and [BridgeDbR](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/BridgeDbR.html) v2.0.0 were used.
```

After having loaded the required R libraries, we read the data and create a new column to include the source of the identifier (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_3133 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=identifier_schema) .

```r
data_df <- read_tsv(filepath, col_names=c('identifier'))
data_df$source = 'H'
``` 

We then load the data for the organism we are mapping from.

```r
 location <- getDatabase('Homo sapiens')
 mapper <- loadDatabase(location)
```

And use the library's     dedicated function to map (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD-NAME_3135 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.53edcc)  the identifier (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_3134 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=identifier_schema) s:

```r
mapping = maps(mapper, data_df, target='En')
```
This will return:
| identifier (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_3136 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=identifier_schema)  | source | target | mapping         |
|:---------- |:------ |:------ |:--------------- |
| A1BG       | H      | En     | ENSG00000121410 |
| A1CF       | H      | En     | ENSG00000148584 |
| A2MP1      | H      | En     | ENSG00000256069 |

As seen earlier when using Python language, we can obtain all possible mappings simply by not specifying the target. This will result in (top 10) 
| identifier (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_3137 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=identifier_schema)  | source | target | mapping      |
|:---------- |:------ |:------ |:------------ |

| A1BG       | H      | X      | 8039748      |
| A1BG       | H      | T      | GO (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD-ABBREV_3138 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.6xq0ee) :0072562   |
| A1BG       | H      | Uc     | uc061drj.1   |

| A1BG       | H      | X      | 51020_at     |

```{warning} 
An error message indicating "Error in download.file" may be thrown. This may be caused by the `timeout` variable being set to too small a value. To remediate the issue, try increasing the timeout variable value by calling `options(timeout=300)`.
```

<!--
This will maybe link to the identifier mapping recipe in the future, where there will be a specific section detailing identifier equivalence files taking into account scientific lenses, as discussed with Egon. 

--------------------------------


### Mapping a local identifier to global identifier
[NEED HELP HERE]
This is a step that should be done manually. In this case an important decision should be made, which identifiers to map to. To decide this you should look for the data source that contains the closest definition of the concepts to the one you used for your local identifiers.

-->

### Mapping local identifier to a different global identifier

```{note} 
 In this section, we assume that we already have an equivalence file containing the mapping of a local identifier to one of the global identifiers. In our case, this will be contained in a TSV where we map our local gene identifier to [HGNC](http://www.genenames.org). One may consult the list of other potential data formats in the {ref}`fcb-identifier-mapping` recipe. The mapping should be **one-to-one** for this recipe. 
```

The TSV (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD-ABBREV_3141 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.a978c9)  mapping file looks as follows:
| local   | source   |
|:--------|:---------|
| aa11    | A1BG     |
| bb34    | A1CF     |
| eg93    | A2MP1    |

You may notice the `source` identifier (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_3142 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=identifier_schema) s correspond with those used in the previous example.


This is how the mapping will work

#### Webservices in Python

As before, we will define variables including the `web-service's URL (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD-ABBREV_3146 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.9d38e2) ` and the `method` that we will use, in this instance: `xRefsBatch`.
We then pass the source column to the `post request` as follows

```python
source_data = case2.source.to_csv(index=False, header=False)
query = batch_request.format('', org=org, source=source)
response2 = requests.post(query, data = source_data)
```
You may notice here that we did not pass a target source, this could be done as specified before. Then, we use `to_df` again and as expected obtain the same dataframe as before.
To see the equivalences with our local identifier (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_3147 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=identifier_schema) s, we can simply join the dataframes, as follows:

```python
local_mapping = mappings.join(case2.set_index('source'), on='original')
```
which will return the following table (first 10 rows)
| original   | source   | mapping      | target   | local   |

Depending on the identifier (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_3180 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=identifier_schema) s and resources, the relation could also be `many-to-many` as shown below.

An example of a mapping via BridgeDb (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD-NAME_3188 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.5ry74y) . You may notice that despite the 1-to-1 relation between `local` and `original` we get a N-to-N relation between `local` and `mapping` due to the N-to-N relation between `original` and `mapping`.
```
````

```{note} 
This many-to-many relationship stems from different *scientific lenses* in the data sources. You can read more about these in {footcite}`batchelor_scientific_nodate`. The core idea is that depending on the domain/application of the data we can consider different entities as unique. While certain proteins could be considered "equal" from a biological perspective they may require differentiation when using a chemical len. This is what then leads to many-to-many relationships.
```

#### R Package

Here, we will follow the same steps as in the previous case. The only difference is that we need to specify the columns/fields to use when loading the data:

```r
data_df <- read_tsv(filepath, col_names=c('local', 'identifier'))
``` 
Then, after computing the mapping, we can join it with the local identifier (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_3189 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=identifier_schema) 

```r
right_join(data_df, mapping)
```
Assuming we did not specify the target data source we obtain the following table (first 10 rows):
| local | identifier (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_3190 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=identifier_schema)  | source | target | mapping      |

In case we did specify the target data source we would get:

| local | identifier (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_3194 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=identifier_schema)  | source | target | mapping         |

## Provenance

BridgeDb (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD-NAME_3202 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.5ry74y)  provides provenance informat (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_3201 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=model_and_format) ion through:
* A call to `/properties/` method of the Webservice
* `getProperties()` in BridgeDbR (passing the mapper as a parameter)

This returns the following informat (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_3203 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=model_and_format) ion for each of the data sources for a given organism:
* Data source name
* Build date
* Series
* Data type
* Data source version
* Schema version

Improvements on provenance are under way (see [here](https://github.com/bridgedb/BridgeDb/issues/164)).

## Code 
You can find ready-made methods to map (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD-NAME_3204 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.53edcc)  using R and Python for the given use cases [here](https://github.com/FAIRplus/the-fair-cookbook/tree/9ad9481be32812b2565f9f9f1897642ae26eddff/content/recipes/interoperability/bridgedb/data). These assume the data has the structure described in this recipe.

## Conclusion

We showed how to use BridgeDb (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD-NAME_3206 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.5ry74y) 's webservices and R package to map (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD-NAME_3207 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.53edcc)  identifier (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_3205 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=identifier_schema) s from different data sources using a minimal dataset. 
BridgeDb (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD-NAME_3208 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.5ry74y)  provides handy functionality to make 'omics' data more interoperable and reusable.
As with all annotation services, it is important to bear in mind the version of the service being used as well as the data on which the service invokation has been performed.
These are aspects of informat (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_3209 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=model_and_format) ion provenance which we plan to provide in the future.
