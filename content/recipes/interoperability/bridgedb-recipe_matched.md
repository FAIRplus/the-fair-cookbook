## Identifier mapping with BridgeDb

{ref}`Interlinking data from different sources <fcb-identifier (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_3829 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=identifier_schema) -map (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_3830 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.53edcc) ping>` is an essential step for data reusability and interoperability. This step requires dedicated tools. With the present recipe, we show how to use [BridgeDb](https://bridgedb.github.io/) to carry out this process.

[BridgeDb](https://bridgedb.github.io/) is an open source tool dedicated to performing identifier (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_3831 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=identifier_schema)  map (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_3834 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.53edcc) ping {footcite}`van_iersel_bridgedb (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_3832 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.5ry74y) _2010`. BridgeDb (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_3833 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.5ry74y)  offers three different interfaces:
* Java API
* R package
* REST Web-services


> üìñ In the context of this recipe, we distinguish between two types of identifier (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_3835 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=identifier_schema) s:
>* *Local identifier (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_3837 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=identifier_schema) s* which refer to identifier (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_3838 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=identifier_schema) s that are minted within an organization or database (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_3836 https://fairsharing.org/search?fairsharingRegistry=Database)  and thus internally defined (i.e. local to said organization). 
>* *Global identifier (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_3839 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=identifier_schema) s* which refer to identifier (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_3840 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=identifier_schema) s that are globally unique and uniquely point to an entity, as available from BridgeDb (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_3841 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.5ry74y) 's [data sources file](https://github.com/bridgedb/datasources)

We will focus here on two distinct cases, depending on the nature of the incoming data. Namely, whether our data is already using global identifier (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_3842 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=identifier_schema) s or only relies on local identifier (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_3843 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=identifier_schema) s. 

In this recipe, we will cover how BridgeDb (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_3845 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.5ry74y) 's R package and webservices can be used to map (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_3846 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.53edcc)  between resource identifier (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_3844 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=identifier_schema) s.

### Mapping a global identifier to other global identifiers
In this case, the input data is a list of elements with an identifier (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_3847 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=identifier_schema)  that is part of [BridgeDb's data sources](https://github.com/bridgedb/datasources). In our example, we will use a list of Homo Sapien Hugo Gene Nomenclature Convention ([HGNC](http://www.genenames.org)) gene identifier (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_3848 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=identifier_schema) s stored in a TSV (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_3850 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.a978c9)  file. The objective is to map (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_3851 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.53edcc)  these to other available gene identifier (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_3849 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=identifier_schema) s.

#### BridgeDb via Webservices using Python
> ‚ùó For this tutorial Python v3.8.5, [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) v1.1.3, and BridgeDb (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_3852 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.5ry74y)  Webservices v0.9.0 were used.

One of the biggest benefits of using BridgeDb (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_3854 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.5ry74y)  webservices is that these can be accessed using most programming languages. Python has become one of the leading programming languages in data science and predictive model (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_3853 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=model_and_format) ling. Despite the lack of a dedicated BridgeDb (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_3855 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.5ry74y)  Python library, we show here how to use the BridgeDb (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_3856 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.5ry74y)  Webservices to perform exemplary map (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_3857 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.53edcc) pings.

We start by defining string (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_3861 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.9b7wvk) s containing the URL (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_3859 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.9d38e2)  of the webservices and the specific method from the Webservices we want to use. In our case, a `batch cross reference`. When doing the query, we need to specify **the organism** and **the source dataset**. We can also *optionally* specify a *target data source* if we only want to map (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_3860 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.53edcc)  to a specific data source, e.g. Ensembl (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_3858 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.fx0mw7) .

```python
url = "https://webservice.bridgedb.org/"
batch_request = url+"{org}/xrefsBatch/{source}{}"
```

If the aim is to map (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_3862 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.53edcc)  only to a specific target data source, then one can check whether the map (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_3863 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.53edcc) ping is supported by invoking the following webservice call:  

```python
mapping_available = "{org}/isMappingSupported/{source}/{target}"
query = url+mapping_available.format(org='Homo sapiens', source='H', target='En')
requests.get(query).text
```

This will return `True` if the map (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_3864 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.53edcc) ping between the given source and target is supported for the given organism or `False` otherwise.

We then load our data into a pandas dataframe and call the requests library using our query.

```python
query = batch_request.format('?dataSource=En', org='Homo sapiens', source='H')
response = requests.post(query, data=data.to_csv(index=False, header=False))
```

The webservice response is now stored in the `response` variable. We can then simply pass this variable to the `to_df` method provided in the `bridgedb (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_3865 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.5ry74y) _script.py` module (see [Code](#Code)). This method will extract the response in text form and turn it into a pandas Dataframe with conveniently named columns and structured data.

The output table will contain the:
* Original identifier (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_3866 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=identifier_schema) 
* Data source that the identifier (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_3867 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=identifier_schema)  is part of
* Map (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_3869 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.53edcc) ped (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_3870 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.31385c)  identifier (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_3868 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=identifier_schema) 
* Data source for the map (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_3872 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.53edcc) ped (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_3873 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.31385c)  identifier (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_3871 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=identifier_schema) 

In our case the output of `to_df` is:

| original   | source   | map (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_3874 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.53edcc) ping         | target   |
|:-----------|:---------|:----------------|:---------|
| A1BG       | HGNC (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_3875 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.amcv1e)  (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_3876 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.29we0s)      | ENSG00000121410 | En       |
| A1CF       | HGNC (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_3877 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.amcv1e)  (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_3878 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.29we0s)      | ENSG00000148584 | En       |
| A2MP1      | HGNC (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_3879 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.amcv1e)  (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_3880 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.29we0s)      | ENSG00000256069 | En       |

If we were to not specify the target data source (by passing an empty string (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_3883 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.9b7wvk)  as the parameter), we would get all the potential map (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_3882 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.53edcc) pings for the given identifier (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_3881 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=identifier_schema) s. In our case (top 10 rows):

| A1BG       | HGNC (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_3902 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.amcv1e)  (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_3903 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.29we0s)      | GO (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_3901 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.6xq0ee) :0002576   | T        |
| A1BG       | HGNC (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_3904 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.amcv1e)  (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_3905 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.29we0s)      | uc061drt.1   | Uc       |
| A1BG       | HGNC (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_3906 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.amcv1e)  (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_3907 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.29we0s)      | 51020_at     | X        |

As one can see, using the BridgeDb (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_3908 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.5ry74y)  webservice via Python is extremely simple and can be easily integrated in an annotation pipeline.


#### BridgeDb via the dedicated R package

```{note} 
For this tutorial R v4.0.3, [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) v1.3.0, and [BridgeDbR](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/BridgeDbR.html) v2.0.0 were used.
```

After having loaded the required R libraries, we read the data and create a new column to include the source of the identifier (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_3909 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=identifier_schema) .

```r
data_df <- read_tsv(filepath, col_names=c('identifier'))
data_df$source = 'H'
``` 

We then load the data for the organism we are map (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_3910 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.53edcc) ping from.

```r
 location <- getDatabase('Homo sapiens')
 mapper <- loadDatabase(location)
```

And use the library's     dedicated function to map (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_3912 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.53edcc)  the identifier (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_3911 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=identifier_schema) s:

```r
mapping = maps(mapper, data_df, target='En')
```
This will return:
| identifier (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_3913 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=identifier_schema)  | source | target | map (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_3914 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.53edcc) ping         |
|:---------- |:------ |:------ |:--------------- |
| A1BG       | H      | En     | ENSG00000121410 |
| A1CF       | H      | En     | ENSG00000148584 |
| A2MP1      | H      | En     | ENSG00000256069 |

As seen earlier when using Python language, we can obtain all possible map (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_3915 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.53edcc) pings simply by not specifying the target. This will result in (top 10) 
| identifier (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_3916 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=identifier_schema)  | source | target | map (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_3917 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.53edcc) ping      |

| A1BG       | H      | X      | 51020_at     |

```{warning} 
An error message indicating "Error in download.file" may be thrown. This may be caused by the `timeout` variable being set to too small a value. To remediate the issue, try increasing the timeout variable value by calling `options(timeout=300)`.
```

<!--
This will maybe link to the identifier mapping recipe in the future, where there will be a specific section detailing identifier equivalence files taking into account scientific lenses, as discussed with Egon. 

--------------------------------


### Mapping a local identifier to global identifier
[NEED HELP HERE]
This is a step that should be done manually. In this case an important decision should be made, which identifiers to map to. To decide this you should look for the data source that contains the closest definition of the concepts to the one you used for your local identifiers.

-->

### Mapping local identifier to a different global identifier

```{note} 
 In this section, we assume that we already have an equivalence file containing the mapping of a local identifier to one of the global identifiers. In our case, this will be contained in a TSV where we map our local gene identifier to [HGNC](http://www.genenames.org). One may consult the list of other potential data formats in the {ref}`fcb-identifier-mapping` recipe. The mapping should be **one-to-one** for this recipe. 
```

The TSV (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_3921 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.a978c9)  map (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_3922 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.53edcc) ping file looks as follows:
| local   | source   |
|:--------|:---------|
| aa11    | A1BG     |
| bb34    | A1CF     |
| eg93    | A2MP1    |

You may notice the `source` identifier (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_3923 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=identifier_schema) s correspond with those used in the previous example.


This is how the map (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_3924 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.53edcc) ping will work

#### Webservices in Python

As before, we will define variables including the `web-service's URL (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_3928 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.9d38e2) ` and the `method` that we will use, in this instance: `xRefsBatch`.
We then pass the source column to the `post request` as follows

```python
source_data = case2.source.to_csv(index=False, header=False)
query = batch_request.format('', org=org, source=source)
response2 = requests.post(query, data = source_data)
```
You may notice here that we did not pass a target source, this could be done as specified before. Then, we use `to_df` again and as expected obtain the same dataframe as before.
To see the equivalences with our local identifier (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_3929 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=identifier_schema) s, we can simply join the dataframes, as follows:

```python
local_mapping = mappings.join(case2.set_index('source'), on='original')
```
which will return the following table (first 10 rows)
| original   | source   | map (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_3930 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.53edcc) ping      | target   | local   |

In case we did specify the `target` argument to be `Ensembl (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_3954 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.fx0mw7)  (En)`, we would instead get

| original   | source   | map (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_3955 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.53edcc) ping         | target   | local   |
|:-----------|:---------|:----------------|:---------|:--------|

Here, we see a `one-to-one` relation between the identifier (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_3963 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=identifier_schema) s in HGNC (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_3966 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.amcv1e)  (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_3968 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.29we0s)  and En while the relation between HGNC (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_3967 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.amcv1e)  (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_3969 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.29we0s)  and UCSC Genome Browser (Uc) or Gene Ontology (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_3962 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=terminology_artefact)  (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_3965 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.6xq0ee)  (T) is `one-to-many`. Depending on the identifier (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_3964 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=identifier_schema) s and resources, the relation could also be `many-to-many` as shown below.

An example of a map (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_3974 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.53edcc) ping via BridgeDb (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_3973 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.5ry74y) . You may notice that despite the 1-to-1 relation between `local` and `original` we get a N-to-N relation between `local` and `map (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_3975 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.53edcc) ping` due to the N-to-N relation between `original` and `map (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_3976 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.53edcc) ping`.
```
````

```{note} 
This many-to-many relationship stems from different *scientific lenses* in the data sources. You can read more about these in {footcite}`batchelor_scientific_nodate`. The core idea is that depending on the domain/application of the data we can consider different entities as unique. While certain proteins could be considered "equal" from a biological perspective they may require differentiation when using a chemical len. This is what then leads to many-to-many relationships.
```

#### R Package

Here, we will follow the same steps as in the previous case. The only difference is that we need to specify the columns/fields to use when loading the data:

```r
data_df <- read_tsv(filepath, col_names=c('local', 'identifier'))
``` 
Then, after computing the map (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_3978 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.53edcc) ping, we can join it with the local identifier (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_3977 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=identifier_schema) 

```r
right_join(data_df, mapping)
```
Assuming we did not specify the target data source we obtain the following table (first 10 rows):
| local | identifier (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_3979 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=identifier_schema)  | source | target | map (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_3980 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.53edcc) ping      |

In case we did specify the target data source we would get:

## Provenance

BridgeDb (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_3993 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.5ry74y)  provides provenance informat (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_3992 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=model_and_format) ion through:
* A call to `/properties/` method of the Webservice
* `getProperties()` in BridgeDb (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_3994 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.5ry74y) R (passing the map (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_3995 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.53edcc) per as a parameter)

This returns the following informat (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_3996 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=model_and_format) ion for each of the data sources for a given organism:
* Data source name
* Build date
* Series
* Data type
* Data source version
* Schema version

Improvements on provenance are under way (see [here](https://github.com/bridgedb/BridgeDb/issues/164)).

## Conclusion

We showed how to use BridgeDb (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_3999 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.5ry74y) 's webservices and R package to map (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_4000 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.53edcc)  identifier (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_3998 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=identifier_schema) s from different data sources using a minimal dataset. 
BridgeDb (URL_TO_INSERT_RECORD_4001 https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.5ry74y)  provides handy functionality to make 'omics' data more interoperable and reusable.
As with all annotation services, it is important to bear in mind the version of the service being used as well as the data on which the service invokation has been performed.
These are aspects of informat (URL_TO_INSERT_TERM_4002 https://fairsharing.org/search?recordType=model_and_format) ion provenance which we plan to provide in the future.
