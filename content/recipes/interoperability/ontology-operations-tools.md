## Main Objectives

This recipe aims to provide `an overview of tools available` to perform a number of key operations using ontologies and relevant to FAIR processes: from `ontology management` to using `ontology for annotation` or `performing ontology mapping`.

It aims to serve as a starting point to identify tools for FAIRifications tasks where ontologies and semantic frameworks are needed. 

```{admonition} disclaimer
It is not intended to provide a comprehensive list covering all possible tools.
```

>The lists of tools are generated either automatically by querying the [bio.tools](https://bio.tools/) repository, or through manual curation. In this last instance, the list produced reflects what is being used in the industry and is influenced by the FAIRplus project partners that have been surveyed for the purpose of this work.

```{warning} 
The content in these tables was generated in March 2021.
For an updated contents, please check the [FAIR tooling repository](https://github.com/FAIRplus/WP3_FAIR_tooling).
To provide feedback on this content or report issues, please do so via the [FAIR Cookbook github issue tracker](https://github.com/FAIRplus/the-fair-cookbook/issues)

## Operations

### Ontology annotation

<!-- <h3 id="Ontology-annotationr">Ontology annotation</h3> -->

Ontoloy Annotation is the process of linking free text or data items to 'tokens' (defined terms from a lexicon) which provide semantic value. For example, free text "type 2 diabetes" can be annotated with [term](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0005148) in the MONDO disease ontology.

<p>
BACKGROUND:Biomedical literature concerns a wide range of concepts, requiring controlled vocabularies to maintain a consistent terminology across different research groups. However, as new concepts are introduced, biomedical literature is prone to ambiguity, specifically in fields that are advancing more rapidly, for example, drug design and development. Entity linking is a text mining task that aims at linking entities mentioned in the literature to concepts in a knowledge base. For example, entity linking can help finding all documents that mention the same concept and improve relation extraction methods. Existing approaches focus on the local similarity of each entity and the global coherence of all entities in a document, but do not take into account the semantics of the domain. RESULTS:We propose a method, PPR-SSM, to link entities found in documents to concepts from domain-specific ontologies

Mapping between Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) and Gene Ontology (GO) terms for the prediction of gene/protein - function - phenotype - disease associations.
<p>
In this study, a novel approach is proposed for the identification of relationships between biomedical entities by automatically mapping phenotypic abnormality defining HPO terms with biomolecular function defining GO terms, where each association indicates the occurrence of the abnormality due to the loss of the biomolecular function expressed by the corresponding GO term

   <td>The tool was developed to manage ontologies (and controlled terminologies e.g. CDISC SEND). The primary goal of the tool is to provide an online collaborative solution for expert curators to map code list terms (sourced from multiple systems/databases) to preferred ontology terms. Other key features include visualisation of ontologies in hierarchical/graph format, advanced search capabilities, peer review/approval workflow and web service access to data.
