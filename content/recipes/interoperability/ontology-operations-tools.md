```` 


## Main Objectives

This recipe aims to provide `an overview of tools available` to perform a number of key operations using ontologies and relevant to FAIR processes: from `ontology management` to using `ontology for annotation` or `performing ontology mapping`.

It aims to serve as a starting point to identify tools for FAIRification tasks where ontologies and semantic frameworks are needed. 

```{admonition} disclaimer
It is not intended to provide a comprehensive list covering all possible tools.
```

>The lists of tools are generated either automatically by querying the [bio.tools](https://bio.tools/) repository, or through manual curation. In this last instance, the list produced reflects what is being used in the industry and is influenced by the FAIRplus project partners that have been surveyed for the purpose of this work.

```{warning} 
The content in these tables was generated in March 2021.
For an updated contents, please check the [FAIR tooling repository](https://github.com/FAIRplus/WP3_FAIR_tooling).
```


## Requirements

* recipe dependency:
   * {ref}`fcb-selecting-ontologies`
* knowledge requirement:
   * be familiar with ontologies and semantic annotation.

## Operations

### Ontology annotation

Ontoloy Annotation is the process of linking free text or data items to 'tokens' (defined terms from a lexicon) which provide semantic value. For example,  "type 2 diabetes" can be annotated with corresponding [term](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0005148) in the MONDO disease ontology.
