<h1 id="Features">Features<a class="anchor-link" href="#Features"> </a></h1><p>This is a short demonstration textbook to show the general layout / style of textbooks built
with Jupyter and Jekyll. The markdown files for <em>this</em> page (and others in the textbook) is generated from the notebooks
with the <code>scripts/generate_textbook.py</code> script, which is called when you run <code>make book</code>.</p>
<p>The content for the book is contained in a folder in the book's repository called <code>content/</code>. It has a
combination of markdown and Jupyter notebooks. This content is rendered into the textbook that you see here!</p>
<p>To begin, click on one of the chapter sections in the sidebar to the left. The first section demonstrates some
simple functionality of this repository, while the following chapters contain a subset of content from the
<a href="https://inferentialthinking.com">Foundations in Data Science</a>.</p>
