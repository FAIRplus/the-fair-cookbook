<p>This document describes the processes used to author FAIR Cookbook related academic
papers, which are typically submitted to peer-reviewed journals. This does not
include talks and posters submitted to conferences unless the conference also
publishes written proceedings.</p>
<p>On one hand, the primary focus of FAIR Cookbook is on producing open-source
documentation and actionable recipes/workflows.  To this day, many
of our core contributors have academic positions and active research programs.
This emphasis is also reflected in the usage of FAIR principles across all areas of
scientific research. 
Given this focus on research, the ongoing academic careers of many FAIR Cookbook
contributors, and our desire to have an impact on computing research, it is
important for us to author and publish peer-reviewed papers on Jupyter itself.
Authoring these papers in the context of a large, open-source community
presents a number of differences compared to many research collaborations.</p>
<h2 id="Principles">Principles<a class="anchor-link" href="#Principles"> </a></h2><p>We have tried to create a process for authoring papers with the following
general principles in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Inclusivity and generosity in authorship.</strong> Hundreds of individuals have
contributed to the different Jupyter subprojects. These contributions span
code, design, documentation, discussions, giving talks/tutorials, etc. We
want to be generous in extending authorship privileges and responsibilities
to as many of these contributors as possible.</li>
<li><strong>Clear, explicit criteria for authorship.</strong> While being generous, we want
have concrete, specific and auditable criteria for including individuals as
authors.</li>
<li><strong>Openness.</strong> The process of authoring papers should be open in the same way
as the rest of the project's work. Thus, all of our papers are written in the
public on GitHub.</li>
<li><strong>Accountability.</strong> Being an author on a paper is a privilege, but also
involves responsibilities. The concrete processes described below elucidate
these responsibilities.</li>
</ul>
<p>We expect to author and submit papers to different types of journals. Different
journals will have slightly different concrete processes that appropriately
embody these principles.</p>
