	abstract = {Ontology mapping is one of the most important tasks for ontology interoperability and its main aim is to find semantic relationships between entities (i.e. concept, attribute, and relation) of two ontologies. However, most of the current methods only consider one to one (1:1) mappings. In this paper we propose a new approach (CHM: Concept Hierarchy based Mapping approach) which can find simple (1:1) mappings and complex (m:1 or 1:m) mappings simultaneously. First, we propose a new method to represent the concept names of entities. This method is based on the hierarchical structure of an ontology such that each concept name of entity in the ontology is included in a set. The parent-child relationship in the hierarchical structure of an ontology is then extended as a set-inclusion relationship between the sets for the parent and the child. Second, we compute the similarities between entities based on the new representation of entities in ontologies. Third, after generating the mapping candidates, we select the best mapping result for each source entity. We design a new algorithm based on the Apriori algorithm for selecting the mapping results. Finally, we obtain simple (1:1) and complex (m:1 or 1:m) mappings. Our experimental results and comparisons with related work indicate that utilizing this method in dealing with ontology mapping is a promising way to improve the overall mapping results.},

	abstract = {UniChem is a freely available compound identifier mapping service on the internet, designed to optimize the efficiency with which structure-based hyperlinks may be built and maintained between chemistry-based resources. In the past, the creation and maintenance of such links at EMBL-EBI, where several chemistry-based resources exist, has required independent efforts by each of the separate teams. These efforts were complicated by the different data models, release schedules, and differing business rules for compound normalization and identifier nomenclature that exist across the organization. UniChem, a large-scale, non-redundant database of Standard InChIs with pointers between these structures and chemical identifiers from all the separate chemistry resources, was developed as a means of efficiently sharing the maintenance overhead of creating these links. Thus, for each source represented in UniChem, all links to and from all other sources are automatically calculated and immediately available for all to use. Updated mappings are immediately available upon loading of new data releases from the sources. Web services in UniChem provide users with a single simple automatable mechanism for maintaining all links from their resource to all other sources represented in UniChem. In addition, functionality to track changes in identifier usage allows users to monitor which identifiers are current, and which are obsolete. Lastly, UniChem has been deliberately designed to allow additional resources to be included with minimal effort. Indeed, the recent inclusion of data sources external to EMBL-EBI has provided a simple means of providing users with an even wider selection of resources with which to link to, all at no extra cost, while at the same time providing a simple mechanism for external resources to link to all EMBL-EBI chemistry resources.},
