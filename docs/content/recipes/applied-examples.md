This Chapter is dedicated to the partial or complete FAIRification processes, as applied by FAIR+ developers to IMI generated datasets and will document critical steps and learnings resulting from these efforts.

We will therefore cover topics such as:

:warning: tentative outline

1. FAIRification of Metabolomics Data: Clarifying the Semantics of Data Matrices
2. FAIRification of Transcriptomics Data: the IMI RESOLUTE use case
3. FAIRification of Toxicology and Chemical exposure Data: the IMI eTOX use case
4. FAIRification of Translational Data: the IMI Oncotrack use case
5. FAIRification of Target Identification Data: the IMI ND4BB use case
6. FAIRification of Stem Cell Data: the IMI2 IBISC use case
....
