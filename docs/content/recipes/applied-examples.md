This Chapter is dedicated to a complete FAIRification example, as applied by FAIR+ developers to public dataset. The content of the chapter documents all critical steps and learnings resulting from these efforts.

We will therefore cover topics such as:

1. FAIRification of Metabolomics Data: Clarifying the Semantics of Data Matrices
2. Zenodo deposition
3. Conversion to an open format - using Frictionless Data Package
4. Building a semantic model and annotating with open ontologies
5. Conversion to RDF/Linked data and exploration with SPARQL
