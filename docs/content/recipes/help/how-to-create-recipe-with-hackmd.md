- [x] 6. :warning: **IMPORTANT: Install HackMD browser extension ([Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hackmd-it/cnephjboabhkldgfpdokefccdofncdjh), [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/hackmd-it/?src=search))**.

At the current time, the `HackMD-it` browser extension is only available for Chrome and Firefox and [this tutorial](https://hackmd.io/s/hackmd-it) details the installation procedure. 
Once you've carried the extension installation, any github repository for which you have access and for which HackMD app has been authorized (which is already the case for all FAIRplus github repositories), any `Markdown` document will be readily editable using 'HackMD' and you should see the following *icon*

in the github repository bar as shown in the figure below:

:warning: This button will only be visible from Chrome or Firefox once the `HackMD` browser extension has been installed. 
:octopus: This will not be visible from Safari, Brave or Internet Explorer browsers *even if* you have HackMD activated for your repository.


- [x] 7. Getting familiar with MarkDown with a [good tutorial provided by Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/technical-writing/markdown-guide/)
