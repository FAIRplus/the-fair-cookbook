# The FAIR Cookbook :construction:

## A brief overview

This is the github repository for the `FAIR Cookbook`, assembled by the [IMI FAIRplus project](https://fairplus-project.eu/), an EU funded project running from *2018 to 2022*. The repository hosts  documentation, known as `FAIR recipes`, and supporting code in the form of `jupyter notebooks` about **`FAIRification processes`** and the content will be released regularly (quarterly) in order to reflect the work progress made by the project and the various working groups bringing together `academic` and `industry` partners.

## Roadmap and Timeline

The FAIRcookbook development process currently operates on a quarterly release cycle. Each cycle sees 2 `scrums` where specific `use cases` or `themes` are chosen and task forces assigned. The outcome of these efforts are new `FAIRification protocols`, or `FAIR recipes`, which after review are integrated to the main FAIRCookbook are tagged for release to the master branch, which is used to build the web-friendly version of the book.

## Technology stack

The `FAIRcoobook` is built using [jupyter-book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html), following the practice used by the Alan Turing's Instute Book of Data Science.

* **[github](https://github.com)** is used to version control and hosting
* **[Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)** is used for the write-up
* **[HackMD](https://hackmd.io)** is used as Markdown Editor thanks to its integration with `github` and its [`browser extensions`](https://hackmd.io/s/hackmd-it)
* **[jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/)** can be used to provide executable code
* **[binder](https://mybinder.org)** is enabled which allows in web execution of any jupyter notebook distributed with the `FAIRCookbook`
* **[mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/)** javascript library is used to produce flowcharts, Gantt charts and pie charts used in the book.
<!--* **[netlify]()** is being tested for web hosting and deployment -->

* **[Jekyll Themes]()** provide the style for the web friendly version. The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file found in. [repository settings](https://github.com/fair-cookbook/the-fair-cookbook/settings).
