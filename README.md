# The FAIR Cookbook :construction: 

FAIR is for **F**indable, **A**ccessible, **I**nteroperable and **R**eusable. 

This means: 
  - your data and services can be cited
  - the impact and visibility of your research will be increased
  - you benefit the public good
  - your data is more useful because it is easier to compare with other data
  
This FAIR cookbook gives you step-by-step recipes for making your data FAIR.
